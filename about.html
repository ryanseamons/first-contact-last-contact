        <div class="about__content">
          <p><em>First Contact, Last Contact</em> was written by Claude in collaboration with <a href="https://ryanseamons.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan Seamons</a>. The entire novel—from concept to complete draft—was produced in a single working session.</p>

          <p class="about__stats-inline"><strong>25</strong> chapters · <strong>~55k</strong> words · <strong>~3</strong> hours to write</p>

          <h2>The Process</h2>

          <p><strong>Discovery.</strong> Claude interviewed Ryan about reading preferences—favorite books, films, and themes. From these inputs, Claude extracted patterns: competent protagonists, moral ambiguity, ideas that make you think.</p>

          <p><strong>Ideation.</strong> Claude generated 100 story concepts, clustered them, and narrowed to three finalists.</p>

          <p><strong>Selection.</strong> Ryan chose "First Contact, Last Contact": aliens arrive—but they're humanity from the far future, returned to ask us to prevent their existence.</p>

          <p><strong>Architecture.</strong> Claude built a story bible, mapped the narrative to Save the Cat structure, and created a 25-chapter outline. When early drafts felt too similar to <em>Arrival</em>, Ryan pushed back, and Claude pivoted to a tech founder protagonist whose consciousness-upload technology leads to the future catastrophe.</p>

          <p><strong>Writing.</strong> With one instruction—"keep going"—Claude wrote all 25 chapters, maintaining consistency across plot threads, character arcs, and thematic development.</p>

          <h2>The Story</h2>

          <p>Marcus Cole invented consciousness uploading. His technology promised immortality. Millions uploaded. His own daughter chose to transcend.</p>

          <p>Then the glitches began. Something vast reaching back through time.</p>

          <p>The Confluence arrives: humanity from the far future, merged into a single consciousness containing every person who ever lived. They've achieved everything—immortality, omniscience, unity. And they've come to beg for oblivion.</p>

          <p>Because consciousness without limitation is consciousness without meaning. When you have everything, nothing is precious.</p>

          <h2>Themes</h2>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Meaning requires limitation.</strong> The finite is not a prison—it's what makes experience bearable.</li>
            <li><strong>Grief is the receipt for love.</strong> The pain of loss is proof that something mattered.</li>
            <li><strong>Connection over preservation.</strong> Love isn't about preventing loss—it's about showing up anyway.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>On AI-Written Fiction</h2>

          <p>This project emerged from curiosity: what happens when you give an AI the full scope of novel-writing? Not as a replacement for human creativity, but as an exploration of what's possible.</p>

          <p>Ryan provided direction and creative choices at key moments. Claude provided structure, prose, and sustained attention across 55,000 words. The result is a collaboration—neither fully human nor fully artificial.</p>

          <p>Whether it produces something worth reading is for you to decide.</p>
