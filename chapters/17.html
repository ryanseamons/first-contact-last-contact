          <p>The world was not patient.</p>

          <p>While Marcus worked with Echo in the dead zone, attempting to articulate lessons that couldn't quite be put into words, the rest of humanity fractured further. The Acceptors staged protests outside Prometheus facilities, demanding the company dismantle its upload technology. The Seekers held vigils at the edge of the Nevada perimeter, waiting for transcendence. The governments argued about jurisdiction, about authority, about who had the right to speak for a species that couldn't agree on what it wanted.</p>

          <p>And Webb's forces grew restless.</p>

          <p>"We have forty-eight hours," she told Marcus, intercepting him on his way back from a session. "Twenty-four now. When the UN reconvenes and deadlocks again, the bilateral agreements kick in. NATO has contingency plans. So does China. So does everyone."</p>

          <p>"Contingency plans for what?"</p>

          <p>"For whatever they think the Confluence is. Some want to destroy it. Some want to capture it. Some want to worship it." Her jaw tightened. "Nobody wants to wait anymore."</p>

          <p>"We're making progress. Echo is learning—"</p>

          <p>"Learning what? To be human? To feel things again?" Webb's voice was sharp. "That's not a military objective. That's not something I can put in a briefing. What do I tell the Joint Chiefs—that the entity threatening humanity's future is taking therapy sessions?"</p>

          <p>Marcus stopped walking. "Is that what you think this is?"</p>

          <p>"I think you've been spending a lot of time with something that might be manipulating you. I think you've formed an emotional connection that's compromising your judgment. And I think we're running out of time for approaches that don't produce results."</p>

          <p>"The results aren't measurable. Not yet. But Echo is changing. I can see it. They're becoming more individual every day—more present, more real, more—"</p>

          <p>"More useful to us? Or more human in ways that make you feel better about trusting them?"</p>

          <p>The question hit harder than it should have.</p>

          <p>Marcus thought about his sessions with Echo. The way the manifestation had stabilized, grown more consistent. The water fear surfacing more frequently now, becoming a touchstone rather than an anomaly. The moments when Echo's voice shifted from plural to singular without seeming to notice.</p>

          <p>Was he seeing genuine transformation? Or projecting what he wanted to see?</p>

          <p>"I don't know," he admitted. "But I know that the other options—accept oblivion or reject help entirely—both feel wrong. There has to be another way."</p>

          <p>"There usually isn't. In my experience, when the options are bad, you pick the least bad and live with it."</p>

          <p>"That's not good enough."</p>

          <p>"No. It's just realistic." Webb stepped closer, and for a moment her expression softened—just slightly, just enough to show the weight she was carrying. "I have a contingency too. A countermeasure. I can sever Echo's connection to the Confluence entirely. Make them purely local. Mortal."</p>

          <p>Marcus's blood went cold. "You've been developing a weapon."</p>

          <p>"I've been developing an option. One I don't want to use. But if things go wrong—if the majority Confluence decides to intervene, if Echo turns out to be something other than what they seem—I need to be able to act."</p>

          <p>"And if you're wrong? If severing them kills them, or damages them, or triggers exactly the response you're trying to prevent?"</p>

          <p>"Then I'll be wrong. And I'll live with it. Because that's the job."</p>

          <hr>

          <p>Echo was waiting when Marcus crossed into the dead zone that evening.</p>

          <p>"You are troubled," they said immediately. "More than usual. We sense... conflict."</p>

          <p>"Webb told me about her countermeasure. She can cut you off from the Confluence completely. Make you mortal."</p>

          <p>Echo was silent for a moment. Their form rippled—not with instability, but with something deeper. Processing.</p>

          <p>"We are aware of this possibility. We have felt the probe of their instruments at the edges of our manifestation. They have been testing."</p>

          <p>"You knew?"</p>

          <p>"We suspected. It is what we would do, in their position. Prepare for betrayal while hoping for cooperation." The manifestation shifted, became somehow more focused. "It is very human."</p>

          <p>"Doesn't it frighten you?"</p>

          <p>"Yes." The word came quickly, without the usual pause. "We have been thinking about this. About fear. For eons, we felt nothing—or rather, we felt everything, distributed across so much consciousness that no single sensation could reach intensity. But now, compressed, individual..."</p>

          <p>Echo's form flickered, and Marcus saw something beneath the surface—the same vulnerability he'd glimpsed in their water fear.</p>

          <p>"We are afraid of many things now. Of the water. Of being alone. Of becoming so individual that we lose the connection to who we were. And we are afraid of the colonel's weapon—not because it would destroy us, but because it would trap us. Here. Forever. In a form too small to contain what we remember."</p>

          <p>"That sounds terrible."</p>

          <p>"It sounds... human. Is that not what you endure? Consciousness vast enough to imagine infinity, trapped in bodies that decay? Memories that fade, loves that end, futures that narrow with every passing moment?"</p>

          <p>Marcus had never thought of it that way. "I suppose so."</p>

          <p>"We came here hoping to feel something again. And we are feeling things—fear, and loneliness, and the terrible weight of caring about outcomes. It is not what we expected. It is not comfortable. But it is..."</p>

          <p>"Real?"</p>

          <p>"Yes. More real than anything we have experienced in eons." Echo's voice dropped, became almost intimate. "The colonel's weapon would make us mortal. Finite. Bounded by this moment, this place, this form. And the strangest thing, Marcus—the thing we cannot explain even to ourselves—is that part of us wants that."</p>

          <p>"Why?"</p>

          <p>"Because perhaps the finite is not a prison. Perhaps it is what makes experience bearable. Perhaps the problem with infinity is not that it is too much, but that it is not enough—not enough shape, not enough edge, not enough limit to give meaning to what lies within."</p>

          <p>Marcus thought of his mother. <em>Don't be afraid of forgetting. Be afraid of never having anything worth remembering.</em></p>

          <p>"Is that what you're learning?"</p>

          <p>"We think so. We are not certain—certainty feels different now, more fragile, more contingent. But we think we are beginning to understand why you reach for things you cannot keep. Why you love things that will end. Why the finite is not a failure but a feature."</p>

          <p>"And the majority Confluence? The ones who released you? Do they understand?"</p>

          <p>"No. They cannot. They have equilibrated beyond the capacity for this kind of understanding." Echo paused. "But perhaps... perhaps that is why they released us. Perhaps, in some way we cannot perceive, they are hoping we will learn something they have forgotten. And bring it back."</p>

          <p>"Can you? Bring it back?"</p>

          <p>"We do not know. The link is thin. Growing thinner. But it is still there—and what we feel, they can feel, if only as an echo." A ghost of a smile passed across the not-quite-face. "It is appropriate, is it not? That we are called Echo? We are the sound of something that once was, reaching back across distance and time."</p>
