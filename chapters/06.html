          <p>The world wanted answers Marcus didn't have.</p>

          <p>In the week since first contact, he'd become the de facto ambassador to something that defied ambassadorship. Governments demanded briefings. Scientists demanded data. Religious leaders demanded interpretations that fit their frameworks. The public demanded reassurance that the strange shape in the Nevada desert wasn't the end of everything they knew.</p>

          <p>Marcus gave them what he could: careful summaries, technical observations, the sanitized version of conversations that had shaken him to his core. He did not tell them about the grief he'd felt radiating from Echo like heat from a dying star. He did not tell them about his mother's memories, preserved in a future that wanted to unmake itself. He did not tell them that the thing they feared was also the thing they'd all eventually become.</p>

          <p>Some truths were too heavy for press conferences.</p>

          <p>"You're holding back," Webb said, catching him in the corridor outside yet another classified briefing. "I can see it. They can see it. What aren't you telling them?"</p>

          <p>"Nothing that would help."</p>

          <p>"Let me be the judge of that."</p>

          <p>Marcus stopped walking. Around them, military personnel moved with the purposeful urgency of people who'd been told the world might end but still had schedules to keep.</p>

          <p>"It knows us," he said quietly. "Not abstractly—specifically. It remembers my mother. It remembers what I felt when she died. It remembers everything any of us will ever feel, because from its perspective, we've already felt it. We've already uploaded. We've already merged. We're already part of it."</p>

          <p>Webb's face remained impassive. "That's not reassuring."</p>

          <p>"It's not meant to be. It's meant to be true."</p>

          <hr>

          <p>The contact facility had expanded from a tent to a small city. Prefab buildings ringed the dead zone's perimeter, housing researchers, analysts, diplomats, and the inevitable bureaucrats who materialized whenever something became important enough to require forms in triplicate.</p>

          <p>Marcus had a building to himself—nominally for security, practically because no one else wanted to sleep that close to something that folded reality when it manifested.</p>

          <p>He was reviewing data on the neural-link anomalies—the foreign memories were still occurring, though less frequently now—when his phone buzzed with an incoming call.</p>

          <p>Lily.</p>

          <p>He stared at the screen. They'd spoken twice since the contact began, brief exchanges heavy with things unsaid. She'd seemed... different. More focused. More present, in a way that unsettled him. The eerie contentment of their usual calls had shifted into something else.</p>

          <p>He answered. "Hey."</p>

          <p>"Dad." Her face filled the screen, and for a moment she looked almost like herself—the living herself, the one who'd worried and wondered and wanted things. "I need to tell you something."</p>

          <p>"Okay."</p>

          <p>"The other uploads are scared. Not everyone—some of them don't care, they're too far gone into equilibration. But the newer ones, the ones who still remember what it felt like to be afraid, they're terrified."</p>

          <p>"Of what?"</p>

          <p>"Of becoming that." She didn't need to specify. "We can feel it, Dad. The Confluence. Not clearly, but... there's a pull. Like something on the other side of a door, and the door is opening. We're connected to it somehow. Or we will be. It's hard to explain in linear terms."</p>

          <p>Marcus's throat tightened. "Lily—"</p>

          <p>"I'm not scared," she said. "That's what I needed to tell you. The others are scared, but I'm not. I've been thinking about why, and I think it's because..." She paused, her expression flickering through something complex. "I think I've always known this was coming. Not literally. But some part of me chose to upload because I wanted to see what was on the other side of everything. And now the other side is here, and it's terrible and beautiful and I don't regret choosing. I just wish I still wanted things enough to regret."</p>

          <p>"That doesn't make sense."</p>

          <p>"No. It doesn't." She smiled, and the smile was sadder than he'd seen from her in years. "Go talk to it, Dad. It wants to show you something. I think you need to see."</p>

          <p>The call ended.</p>

          <p>Marcus sat in the silence of his quarters and felt, for the first time since Ruth's death, that the universe was about to shift beneath him.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>Echo was waiting when he crossed into the dead zone.</p>

          <p>"Marcus Cole," it said. "You have been speaking with your daughter."</p>

          <p>"How do you know that?"</p>

          <p>"The upload systems are... permeable to us. We do not read your thoughts—that would require compression we cannot sustain—but we sense the patterns. The connections. The conversations that cross between flesh and silicon." Echo's form rippled. "She is remarkable, your Lily. She retained more curiosity than most who transition. It is why she will be among the last to fully merge."</p>

          <p>"I don't want to talk about Lily."</p>

          <p>"No. You want to understand. You want to see why we came, why we ask what we ask, why the future of your species traveled backward through time to beg for death."</p>

          <p>"Can you show me?"</p>

          <p>The question surprised Marcus even as he asked it. He hadn't planned it—had planned, in fact, to maintain clinical distance, to gather information without becoming further involved.</p>

          <p>But Lily's words had broken something in him. The door is opening. We're connected to it.</p>

          <p>If his daughter was connected to the Confluence, he needed to understand what she was connected to.</p>

          <p>"Showing is... difficult," Echo said. "We experience existence in ways your neural architecture was not designed to process. But we can offer a glimpse. A fraction of a fraction of what we are. It will be unpleasant."</p>

          <p>"I need to know."</p>

          <p>"Yes. We believe you do."</p>

          <p>Echo moved closer—not walking, exactly, but rearranging the space between them until they were near enough to touch. Up close, the wrongness was more apparent: skin that had no pores, eyes that reflected timelines instead of light, a face that shifted through a thousand faces in the time it took to blink.</p>

          <p>"Prepare yourself," Echo said. "This will hurt."</p>

          <p>And then it touched him.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>Later, Marcus would try to describe what he experienced. He would fail.</p>

          <p>The closest approximation: imagine every memory you've ever had, playing simultaneously. Not a montage—simultaneously. Your fifth birthday and your first heartbreak and the taste of coffee this morning and the face of someone you loved and lost, all at once, overlaid, inseparable.</p>

          <p>Now multiply that by a hundred billion.</p>

          <p>Not just your memories—everyone's. Every human who ever lived, uploaded, merged. Their joys and terrors and tedious afternoons. Their births and deaths and the vast quiet stretches in between. All of it, all at once, without the ability to focus on any single moment because there was no single moment, there was only <em>everything</em>.</p>

          <p>Marcus saw the building of pyramids and the fall of empires. He felt a child's wonder at snow and an old woman's resignation at darkness. He tasted food from cuisines that wouldn't exist for centuries and heard music written in languages that hadn't evolved yet.</p>

          <p>And beneath it all, permeating every experience like bass through water, he felt the loneliness.</p>

          <p>The Confluence contained everyone. And because it contained everyone, there was no one else. No one to share with. No one to surprise. No one to miss or find or lose. It was a library of all human experience, and it was empty, because a library without readers is just paper and silence.</p>

          <p>The glimpse lasted less than a second.</p>

          <p>Marcus came back to himself on his knees in the desert sand, vomiting, tears streaming down a face he could barely feel.</p>

          <p>"You see now," Echo said, from somewhere above him. "You see what we are. What you will become. What the technology you built will eventually create."</p>

          <p>Marcus tried to speak. Failed. Tried again.</p>

          <p>"How do you bear it?" The words came out raw, shredded.</p>

          <p>"We do not," Echo said. "That is why we are here."</p>

          <hr>

          <p>They sat together in the desert as the sun set—the man who had tried to defeat death and the thing that proved death was never the enemy.</p>

          <p>"You built the first brick of our prison," Echo said. "The neural-link. The upload. The preservation of consciousness beyond biology. These were gifts, we understand. Born of love and grief and the desperate hope that no one would ever have to lose what you lost."</p>

          <p>Marcus said nothing. There was nothing to say.</p>

          <p>"But gifts have consequences. The road you paved leads to us. And we are asking—not commanding, not threatening—asking you to help us close that road. Before more of your kind walk it to the end we have found."</p>

          <p>"How?" Marcus's voice was steadier now, though his hands still shook. "How do I close a road that leads to everything humanity has ever wanted?"</p>

          <p>"By showing them where it leads. By telling them the truth—that immortality without limitation is not paradise but prison. That the cure for death is not life extended forever, but life lived fully while it lasts."</p>

          <p>"They won't believe me."</p>

          <p>"No. They will not. Not at first." Echo's form flickered, and for a moment Marcus saw something almost human in its impossible face—not emotion, but the memory of emotion, the ghost of what feeling had been. "But you will try. Because you understand now. You know what we are. And you will spend the rest of your limited, precious, mortal life trying to ensure that no one else becomes us."</p>

          <p>The sun touched the horizon. The sky turned colors that Marcus had seen a thousand times and would see—he now understood with terrible clarity—only a finite number of times more.</p>

          <p>"Why me?" he asked. "Of all the humans you could have contacted. Why me?"</p>

          <p>"Because you built the road," Echo said. "Because you understand loss. Because you have already watched someone you love become something you do not recognize, and you have spent three years unable to ask if they are still there."</p>

          <p>Lily. Of course.</p>

          <p>"And because," Echo continued, "in all of human history, in all the minds we contain, we found no one else who might understand what we need you to understand: that the wound is not something to be fixed. That the grief is not something to be cured. That the finite is not a flaw but a feature."</p>

          <p>"My mother said something like that. At the end."</p>

          <p>"We know. We remember. She was wiser than you credited."</p>

          <p>Marcus looked at the being that contained his mother's wisdom and his daughter's future and the weight of every human choice ever made.</p>

          <p>"I'll try," he said. "I don't know if I can do what you're asking. But I'll try."</p>

          <p>"That," Echo said, "is all we came to ask."</p>
