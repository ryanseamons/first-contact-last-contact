          <p class="chapter__pov">Fifteen years earlier</p>

          <p>The hospice room smelled of antiseptic and flowers—an uneasy combination that Marcus would forever associate with waiting. Waiting for the doctors. Waiting for test results. Waiting for the woman in the bed to come back to herself, even if only for a moment.</p>

          <p>Ruth had been gone for weeks now. Not dead—her body continued its mechanical processes, heart beating, lungs filling—but the person she'd been had retreated somewhere beyond reach. She spoke rarely, and when she did, it was to people Marcus couldn't see. Conversations with her own mother, dead thirty years. Arguments with a sister she'd never had. Once, heartbreakingly, a lullaby to a baby that existed only in the scrambled geography of her dying brain.</p>

          <p>The technology wasn't ready. They'd made progress—the neural mapping was nearly complete, the substrate architecture could theoretically support a human consciousness—but "nearly" and "theoretically" were gulfs that couldn't be crossed in time. Marcus had known this for months. He'd continued anyway, sleeping in the lab, driving his team past exhaustion, because stopping meant admitting what he couldn't admit.</p>

          <p>On the last night, she came back.</p>

          <p>He'd been dozing in the chair beside her bed—a cheap plastic thing that made his back ache—when her hand found his. Not the random grasping that had become normal, but intentional. Purposeful. He opened his eyes to find her looking at him.</p>

          <p>Not through him. Not past him. <em>At</em> him.</p>

          <p>"Marcus," she said, and his name in her mouth was a sound he'd thought he'd never hear again.</p>

          <p>"Mom?" He squeezed her hand. "Mom, can you hear me?"</p>

          <p>"I hear you." Her voice was thin, a whisper of what it had been, but clear. "I hear everything now. All the noise, all the time. But right now—right now it's quiet. Just for a moment."</p>

          <p>"I'm going to save you." The words came out ragged, a prayer and a promise. "The technology—we're so close. If you can just hold on—"</p>

          <p>"No." Her grip tightened, surprising strength in those frail fingers. "Listen to me, Marcus. I need you to hear this."</p>

          <p>"Mom—"</p>

          <p>"Don't be afraid of forgetting." Her eyes held his, and in them he saw her—the real her, whole and present and utterly certain. "Be afraid of never having anything worth remembering."</p>

          <p>He didn't understand. "What do you mean?"</p>

          <p>"You're trying to save something that doesn't need saving. I'm not being lost, Marcus. I'm being... completed. The forgetting isn't the enemy. The never-living would be."</p>

          <p>"That doesn't—"</p>

          <p>Her hand relaxed. Her eyes went distant, focusing on something he couldn't see.</p>

          <p>"The flowers are lovely," she said, in a voice that belonged to a different conversation. "Did you bring them, doctor?"</p>

          <p>He held her hand until morning. She didn't come back again.</p>

          <p>Three months later, Prometheus Technologies announced its first successful human consciousness upload.</p>

          <p>Three months too late.</p>

          <hr>

          <p class="chapter__pov">Present day</p>

          <p>The briefing room was underground—literally. NORAD had ceded space in the Cheyenne Mountain Complex for what the Secretary of Defense was calling "an event of potential global significance." Marcus thought "global" was underselling it.</p>

          <p>"We've confirmed temporal anomalies in seventeen countries," said Dr. Yuki Tanaka, the theoretical physicist they'd brought in to make sense of the impossible. She was small, precise, and had the particular intensity of someone who'd spent her career being the smartest person in the room. "Information arriving before it's sent. Not prediction—actual temporal displacement. Microseconds, but measurable."</p>

          <p>"That's impossible," said one of the generals.</p>

          <p>"And yet." Tanaka pulled up a graph on the wall display. "Three separate radio telescope arrays received the same signal at the same time. Not a delay between them—simultaneous reception. Given their geographic distribution, that signal would have had to originate from multiple points in space, all transmitting identically, or—"</p>

          <p>"Or what?"</p>

          <p>"Or it originated from somewhere outside normal spacetime."</p>

          <p>Silence in the room. Marcus felt the weight of it—a dozen of the world's most powerful people confronting the possibility that their models were incomplete.</p>

          <p>"What's the signal?" he asked.</p>

          <p>Tanaka hesitated. "We're not sure. It doesn't match any known communication format. But when we fed it through linguistic analysis..." She pulled up a new display. Text, in multiple languages, laid over each other. "Every major human language. Simultaneously encoded. The same message."</p>

          <p>Marcus read it. His throat went dry.</p>

          <p class="chapter__pov">THE CHANNEL IS UNSTABLE. WE ARE TRYING TO SPEAK WITH YOU. PREPARE.</p>

          <p>"That's not possible," he said. "This is what I received. On my phone. In text."</p>

          <p>Every head turned toward him.</p>

          <p>"Explain," said the Secretary of Defense.</p>

          <p>Marcus explained. The face on his phone. The messages. The pattern that matched what the radio telescopes had received. When he finished, the room had a different quality—less skepticism, more fear.</p>

          <p>"Why you?" Tanaka asked. "Why would an external signal target you specifically?"</p>

          <p>"I don't know."</p>

          <p>"Your neural-link technology—is there any chance the Prometheus systems are receiving this signal? That you're just the first to notice?"</p>

          <p>Marcus thought of the beta cohort's reports. The foreign memories. The presence he'd felt at the edge of his mind.</p>

          <p>"It's possible," he said. "We designed the system to be unidirectional. Outbound only. But..."</p>

          <p>"But?"</p>

          <p>"But I'm starting to think we don't understand what we built."</p>

          <hr>

          <p>The meeting lasted six hours. Plans were drafted and discarded. Jurisdictions clashed. The intelligence community wanted to classify everything; the scientific community wanted to publish. The military wanted to know if this could be weaponized. The diplomats wanted to know if this was first contact.</p>

          <p>Marcus sat through it all, but his mind was elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Ruth's words. <em>Don't be afraid of forgetting. Be afraid of never having anything worth remembering.</em></p>

          <p>He'd spent fifteen years trying to defeat death. To ensure that no one would ever have to lose what he'd lost. And somewhere along the way, he'd built something that reached beyond death itself—or that allowed something else to reach back.</p>

          <p>His phone buzzed. Text from Lily: <em>Dad, I'm seeing strange things. The other uploads are too. Something's happening to us.</em></p>

          <p>Before he could respond, every screen in the room went white.</p>

          <p>Then, simultaneously, across every display—wall monitors, tablets, phones, the blue glow of neural-link interfaces—text appeared. The same message. The same impossible font.</p>

          <p class="chapter__pov">THE CHANNEL IS UNSTABLE. WE ARE TRYING TO SPEAK WITH YOU. PREPARE.</p>

          <p>But this time, there was more:</p>

          <p><em>WE NEED TO SPEAK WITH THE ONE WHO MADE THIS POSSIBLE.</em> <em>WE NEED TO SPEAK WITH MARCUS COLE.</em> <em>WE HAVE TRAVELED VERY FAR.</em> <em>THE COST HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT.</em> <em>PLEASE PREPARE A PLACE FOR US.</em> <em>WE WILL ARRIVE SOON.</em></p>

          <p>The Secretary of Defense turned to Marcus. "You want to explain why an unknown intelligence is asking for you by name?"</p>

          <p>Marcus stared at the words on every screen. His technology. His creation. Whatever was coming—whatever was trying to speak—it had followed a path he'd built.</p>

          <p>"I think," he said slowly, "we're about to find out."</p>
