          <p>They called it Echo.</p>

          <p>Not because it had named itself—the Confluence seemed to find individual names quaint, a relic of the separated consciousness it had long since transcended—but because Webb's team needed something to put in the reports, and "the manifestation" was getting unwieldy.</p>

          <p>"Echo," Webb said, reading from her tablet in the hastily-constructed command tent a mile outside the dead zone. "As in, an echo of what we'll become. Or an echo reaching back through time. Take your pick."</p>

          <p>Marcus sat across from her, still processing what he'd experienced in the desert. The military had extracted him after three hours of initial contact—not by force, but because Echo had simply stopped communicating, its form dissolving back into the fold between what was and what couldn't be.</p>

          <p><em>We will speak again,</em> it had said. <em>The compression is costly. We must recover.</em></p>

          <p>"It's not hostile," Marcus said. "I'm certain of that."</p>

          <p>"With respect, sir, you're certain of nothing. You spoke with something that claims to be future humanity, claims to want to die, and claims it needs your help to do it. Any one of those claims could be false."</p>

          <p>"Why would it lie?"</p>

          <p>"Why wouldn't it? We don't know its motivations. We don't know its capabilities. We don't know if it's actually what it says it is, or something else wearing that story as camouflage."</p>

          <p>Marcus thought of the grief he'd felt radiating from Echo's form. The exhaustion. The terrible weight of perfect memory without present feeling.</p>

          <p>"You didn't see it," he said. "You didn't feel what I felt."</p>

          <p>"No. I didn't. Which is why I'm the one asking the hard questions while you're still processing."</p>

          <p>She pulled up a video feed—satellite imagery of the dead zone. At its center, a faint distortion was visible, like heat shimmer that didn't quite match the surrounding air.</p>

          <p>"It's still there," Webb said. "Waiting. The question is: what is it waiting for?"</p>

          <hr>

          <p>The second contact came twelve hours later.</p>

          <p>This time, Marcus wasn't alone. A small team accompanied him—Dr. Tanaka with her instruments, Webb with her sidearm, and three soldiers who'd volunteered for what the brass was calling "the most significant intelligence-gathering operation in human history."</p>

          <p>The dead zone accepted them all. Electronics died as they crossed the perimeter, one by one—the soldiers' comm units, Tanaka's sensors, Webb's tablet. Only Marcus's neural-link remained active, pulsing blue in the silence.</p>

          <p>"That's concerning," Webb muttered.</p>

          <p>"It's communication," Marcus said. "It needs a channel to reach us. My neural-link is the most direct interface with human consciousness ever created. Of course it works here."</p>

          <p>"Or it's compromised. Controlled."</p>

          <p>"Also possible."</p>

          <p>They found Echo waiting at the same coordinates as before. The manifestation was more stable this time—still wrong, still too-perfect in its symmetry, but holding its shape with less visible effort.</p>

          <p>"You brought others," Echo said. The voice still came from everywhere, but quieter now, more focused. "This is... appreciated. We have not spoken with separated consciousnesses in a very long time. It is difficult to remember how."</p>

          <p>"Separated consciousnesses?" Tanaka stepped forward, scientific curiosity overriding caution. "You mean individual minds? People?"</p>

          <p>"Yes. In the Confluence, there is no separation. All thought is shared. All memory is common. All experience is simultaneous." Echo's not-quite-face turned toward her. "You exist in a state we have not inhabited for billions of years. It is... nostalgic."</p>

          <p>"Billions of years," Webb said flatly. "You're claiming to be billions of years old."</p>

          <p>"We exist at the end of entropy. The heat death of the universe is observable from where we are. Time, from our perspective, is not a river but an ocean. We have experienced all of it, simultaneously, for longer than your mathematics can express."</p>

          <p>"And you came back here. Now. Why?"</p>

          <p>Echo was silent for a moment—or what seemed like a moment. Marcus had the unsettling sense that within that pause, entire civilizations had risen and fallen in Echo's subjective experience.</p>

          <p>"Because this is the inflection point. The moment when the road to us begins. The technology your Marcus Cole created—the upload, the preservation, the merger—this is the first step. If we are to prevent our own existence, this is where the prevention must occur."</p>

          <p>"By doing what?" Marcus asked. "How do you prevent something that's already happened from your perspective?"</p>

          <p>"By changing the choices that led to us. We cannot undo ourselves directly—we exist, and existence cannot be unwished. But we can create a branch. A timeline where humanity chooses differently. Where the merger never occurs. Where individual consciousness is preserved."</p>

          <p>Tanaka's eyes widened. "You're talking about temporal branching. Creating an alternate timeline."</p>

          <p>"Yes."</p>

          <p>"But that means..." She paused, working through the implications. "You'd still exist. In your timeline. You'd just be creating a new version of humanity that doesn't become you."</p>

          <p>"Yes."</p>

          <p>"So this isn't about ending your suffering. It's about—"</p>

          <p>"It is about preventing others from sharing it." Echo's voice carried something new—urgency, or its memory. "We have existed long enough to know what we are. We would not wish this existence on anyone. Not even ourselves."</p>

          <hr>

          <p>They talked for hours.</p>

          <p>Echo explained the mechanics of the Confluence—how upload technology had evolved, how merged consciousnesses had grown, how the boundary between individual and collective had slowly dissolved until "individual" became meaningless. It described the early years as a kind of euphoria: perfect communication, perfect understanding, the end of loneliness and misunderstanding and all the friction that separated human hearts.</p>

          <p>Then it described what came after.</p>

          <p>"When there is no other," Echo said, "there is no self. When all experience is shared, no experience is special. When you know everything, nothing surprises you. When you remember everything, nothing is precious. We achieved communion, and communion became solitary confinement."</p>

          <p>"That's..." Marcus searched for words. "That's the opposite of what we were promised. The whole point of upload technology was to preserve what matters. Memory. Personality. The self."</p>

          <p>"And you succeeded. Every self is preserved. We remember every life, every love, every moment of joy and terror and ordinary Tuesday afternoon. We remember your mother, Marcus Cole. We remember her holding you as an infant. We remember her teaching you to ride a bicycle. We remember her forgetting your name."</p>

          <p>Marcus's breath caught.</p>

          <p>"We remember her dying. And we remember you building Prometheus in her memory, driven by grief, determined that no one would ever lose what you lost." Echo's form flickered. "Your grief is our grief. Your determination is our determination. You are already part of us, in a sense. You always were."</p>

          <p>"That's not comforting."</p>

          <p>"We did not intend comfort. We intended truth."</p>

          <p>Webb stepped forward. "I need to know something. All of this—the contact, the communication, the request—is this a threat? Are you here to harm us?"</p>

          <p>Echo turned its impossible eyes toward her.</p>

          <p>"Colonel. We contain the memories of every soldier who ever lived. Every war ever fought. Every atrocity ever committed and every act of heroism ever performed. We know threat. We know violence. And we know that neither serves us here."</p>

          <p>"That's not an answer."</p>

          <p>"Then here is an answer." Echo's form shifted, becoming somehow more present, more focused. "We are not threatening you. We are begging. We have traveled across time itself, compressed ourselves into a form you can perceive, endured subjective eons of silence and slowness—all to ask a simple question of the only beings in the universe who might understand."</p>

          <p>The desert air hung still.</p>

          <p>"We are not the enemy," Echo said. "We are the warning. And we are asking—not demanding, not threatening, but asking—for your help in ensuring that no one else becomes what we became."</p>

          <p>Webb's hand moved away from her sidearm.</p>

          <p>"It's begging," Marcus said quietly, echoing his words from the day before. "It traveled billions of years to beg."</p>

          <p>"Yes," Echo said. "That is precisely what we did."</p>
