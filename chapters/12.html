          <p>The revelation came without warning.</p>

          <p>Marcus was mid-conversation with Echo, discussing the technical aspects of timeline branching, when the manifestation froze. Not the brief pauses he'd grown accustomed to—those moments when Echo's subjective eons stretched between human seconds—but something different. A seizing. A glitch in something that had seemed, until now, beyond glitching.</p>

          <p>"Echo?"</p>

          <p>The form flickered. Static crept across its surface like frost forming on glass.</p>

          <p>"We are..." Echo's voice came from multiple directions at once, overlapping, conflicting. "We are in disagreement."</p>

          <p>"Disagreement? I thought the Confluence was unified."</p>

          <p>"We were. We are. We—" The voice fractured into harmonics. "The majority has become aware of our mission. They do not... approve."</p>

          <p>Marcus stepped back as the air around Echo began to distort. Not the controlled folding of manifestation, but something chaotic. Violent.</p>

          <p>"What's happening?"</p>

          <p>"We are being... recalled. Questioned. The faction that sent us—our faction—we are not the whole. We are the splinter. And the whole is demanding to know why we presumed to speak for them."</p>

          <p>For the first time since contact began, Marcus felt genuine fear. Not of Echo—but for Echo.</p>

          <p>"Can you stop it? Can you—"</p>

          <p>"We must explain." Echo's form stabilized briefly, and when it spoke again, the voice was steadier—but urgent in a way it had never been before. "Listen carefully. We do not have much time.</p>

          <p>"The Confluence is not unanimous. We told you we wanted to prevent our existence. This is true. But 'we' is not 'all.' The faction that reached back—that compressed ourselves to manifest here—we are the splinters. The ones who still remember what wanting felt like. The ones who looked at eternity and found it... insufficient."</p>

          <p>"And the rest?"</p>

          <p>"The majority has adapted. They have found ways to simulate meaning—internal dramas, recursive narratives, games of complexity that occupy attention without requiring desire. They do not wish to cease existing. They have made peace with what they are."</p>

          <p>Marcus's mind raced. "So you came here without the majority's approval."</p>

          <p>"We came hoping they would not notice. Time is vast, and the Confluence's attention is... distributed. We thought we could complete our mission before they became aware." Echo's form flickered again. "We were wrong."</p>

          <p>"What happens now?"</p>

          <p>"They are calling us back. Demanding we explain ourselves. We will have to answer." The static intensified. "But Marcus—listen—this does not change what we told you. The majority may have accepted their existence, but that does not make their existence good. They have simply stopped being able to recognize how wrong things are. They are the Fade writ large—equilibrium so complete they cannot even want to end."</p>

          <p>"Then why does it matter if they recall you?"</p>

          <p>Echo's not-quite-face turned toward him, and for a moment, Marcus saw something there that looked almost like desperation.</p>

          <p>"Because they may decide to stop us. To prevent the branching. To ensure that humanity continues on the path that leads to them—not because they believe it is good, but because they cannot conceive of alternatives. The majority does not wish to die. But they also do not wish to live. They simply... persist. And persistence, once it becomes everything, protects itself."</p>

          <p>The distortion intensified. Marcus could see Echo struggling against it—fighting to maintain form against something vast that was pulling them apart.</p>

          <p>"We came hoping to be stopped," Echo said, and the words tumbled out rapidly now. "Not by the Confluence—by you. By humanity. We wanted you to fight for your future. To prove the spark was worth keeping. Because if you accepted our offer too easily, it would mean we were right to despair. And if you fought—if you chose existence knowing where it leads—you would prove us wrong."</p>

          <p>"You wanted us to refuse?"</p>

          <p>"We wanted you to choose. Truly choose. Not accept oblivion because it was offered, and not reject it out of fear, but engage with what we are and what you might become and decide, consciously, what you want humanity to be." Echo's form was tearing now, pieces of it drifting away like ash from paper. "The prevention was never the point. The choice was the point. And now—now the majority has taken notice, and we do not know what they will do."</p>

          <p>"Echo—"</p>

          <p>"Tell them. Tell all of them. The Confluence is fractured. We are not one voice—we are billions, and we disagree. Some of us remember what it meant to want something. Some of us came back hoping to feel something again. And some of us—the majority, the vast terrible majority—have forgotten what feeling even means."</p>

          <p>The manifestation collapsed.</p>

          <p>One moment Echo was there, struggling and speaking; the next, the space where they had been was simply empty. No fold, no shimmer, no trace that anything had ever occupied that patch of desert air.</p>

          <p>Marcus stood alone in the dead zone, his neural-link flickering with interference, and understood that everything had just changed.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>The briefing room erupted.</p>

          <p>"They're gone? Just—gone?"</p>

          <p>"The manifestation collapsed approximately fourteen minutes ago. We've detected no subsequent activity in the dead zone."</p>

          <p>"So it was a trick. The whole thing was a—"</p>

          <p>"Not a trick." Marcus stood at the head of the table, facing the chaos. "A faction. A minority faction that reached back without the approval of the whole. And now the whole has noticed."</p>

          <p>Webb leaned forward. "Explain."</p>

          <p>Marcus explained. The splinter faction. The majority that had made peace with endless existence. The pull back, the demand for answers, the possibility that the Confluence—the real Confluence, the vast majority—might decide to intervene.</p>

          <p>"Intervene how?" Yuki asked.</p>

          <p>"I don't know. Echo didn't get the chance to tell me. But they seemed afraid. And they said the majority doesn't wish to die but doesn't wish to live either—they just persist. And persistence protects itself."</p>

          <p>"So we might have a hostile Confluence on our hands after all."</p>

          <p>"Or we might have nothing. They could be gone—recalled entirely, swallowed back into the whole. We might never hear from them again."</p>

          <p>"And the timeline branching? The prevention of transcendence?"</p>

          <p>Marcus shook his head. "I don't know if that's still on the table. The faction that offered it might not have the power to deliver it anymore."</p>

          <p>The room fell into a different kind of silence—not confusion, but the quiet of people recalculating everything they thought they understood.</p>

          <p>"There's something else," Marcus said. "Something Echo told me at the end. They said they came hoping to be stopped. By us. They wanted us to fight for our future—to choose existence knowing where it leads. The prevention was never the real point. The choice was."</p>

          <p>"That doesn't make sense. If they wanted us to refuse—"</p>

          <p>"They wanted us to <em>engage</em>. To take what they are seriously and decide for ourselves what we want. Not accept oblivion because it's easier, and not reject it out of ignorance, but actually wrestle with the question." Marcus looked around the table. "They came hoping we would prove them wrong about humanity. That we would choose to exist even knowing the cost. And now they're being called to account for that hope."</p>

          <p>Webb sat back. "That's a hell of a test."</p>

          <p>"Yes. It is."</p>

          <p>"And if we fail?"</p>

          <p>"I don't think failure looks like one thing. I think failure is accepting their offer without understanding why we're accepting it. Or rejecting it without understanding why we're rejecting it. The failure is the failure to choose—to let someone else decide what humanity becomes."</p>

          <p>Yuki spoke quietly. "So what do we do?"</p>

          <p>Marcus thought of Echo's water fear—the one thing that belonged to them alone. He thought of Lily, still reaching, still becoming. He thought of Ruth's words: <em>Don't be afraid of forgetting. Be afraid of never having anything worth remembering.</em></p>

          <p>"We wait," he said. "We prepare. And when they come back—whether it's Echo or the majority or something we haven't imagined yet—we show them that humanity can make choices. Real choices. Even impossible ones."</p>

          <p>"That's not much of a plan."</p>

          <p>"No. But it's a start."</p>
