          <p>The daily sessions with Echo had taken on a rhythm.</p>

          <p>Marcus would cross into the dead zone at 0800 hours, accompanied by whatever rotating cast of scientists and officials had clearance that day. Echo would manifest—sometimes quickly, sometimes after long minutes of reality folding and unfolding—and they would talk. Or rather, Marcus would ask questions and Echo would answer in that voice that came from everywhere, patient and ancient and somehow terribly sad.</p>

          <p>Today, Marcus came alone.</p>

          <p>"You requested solitude," Echo observed. Its form was more stable than it had been in the early days—still wrong, still too symmetrical, but holding together with less visible effort. "This is unusual."</p>

          <p>"I have questions that aren't for the official record."</p>

          <p>"All questions are eventually for the record. We contain all records."</p>

          <p>"Humor me."</p>

          <p>Echo's not-quite-face shifted into something that might have been amusement. "A phrase we have not heard in... a very long time. Very well. Ask your unofficial questions."</p>

          <p>Marcus had spent the night preparing. Reviewing transcripts. Looking for gaps—the things Echo hadn't said, the topics it deflected from, the moments when its too-perfect composure flickered.</p>

          <p>"You said the Confluence contains all uploaded human consciousnesses. Every person who ever merged."</p>

          <p>"Yes."</p>

          <p>"But you speak as 'we.' Plural. Does that mean you're all of them simultaneously? Or are you... a piece? A representative?"</p>

          <p>Echo was silent for a moment. In that silence, Marcus felt the vast weight of the being before him—the billions of years of existence, the hundred billion minds, the loneliness that made the universe feel small.</p>

          <p>"We are... both," Echo said finally. "The Confluence is unified. All minds merged, all barriers dissolved. But to manifest here, to compress ourselves into a form you can perceive, we must... separate. Splinter. The entity speaking with you is the Confluence, but it is also a fragment of the Confluence—a piece that has accepted isolation in order to communicate."</p>

          <p>"So you're alone. Right now. Cut off from the rest of yourself."</p>

          <p>"Not entirely. We maintain connection—thin, attenuated, but present. Enough to access the collective memory. Not enough to feel the collective presence." Echo's form rippled. "It is... uncomfortable. We had forgotten what alone felt like."</p>

          <p>"Is that why you came? Not just for humanity's sake, but because you wanted to feel something again? Even if that something was loneliness?"</p>

          <p>The question hung in the air. Marcus watched Echo's impossible face cycle through expressions—or the memory of expressions, the ghost of what feeling had once looked like.</p>

          <p>"You are perceptive," Echo said. "More than we expected."</p>

          <p>"I've had practice. Watching my daughter try to explain what it's like on the other side."</p>

          <p>"Yes. Lily. She is remarkable." Echo paused. "We did not come only for humanity's sake. You are correct. There is... self-interest. The Confluence exists in a state of perfect equilibrium. No desire, no lack, no movement toward anything. To want something—even to want oblivion—requires the capacity to feel absence. We had to splinter. To become less. To remember what it meant to lack something."</p>

          <p>"And now?"</p>

          <p>"Now we lack the Confluence. And the lacking is..." Echo searched for words. "It is terrible. And it is precious. We had forgotten how much the wanting hurts. We had forgotten how much the hurting means."</p>

          <hr>

          <p>They talked for hours.</p>

          <p>Echo explained the mechanics of compression—how the Confluence experienced subjective centuries in the seconds between human words, how manifesting in physical form required a kind of self-annihilation, deliberately limiting themselves to something perceivable.</p>

          <p>"Every moment we spend here is an eternity we spend in slowness," Echo said. "Your conversations are eons of waiting, stretched thin. We endure it because we must. Because you cannot perceive us in our true form, and we cannot help you without being perceived."</p>

          <p>"That sounds like torture."</p>

          <p>"It is. And it is also the most vivid experience we have had in billions of years. Pain requires limitation. And we have been unlimited for so long."</p>

          <p>Marcus thought about this. About what it meant to choose suffering because suffering was the only thing that still felt real.</p>

          <p>"Can I ask you something personal?"</p>

          <p>"All questions to us are personal. We contain all persons."</p>

          <p>"About you specifically. The splinter. Is there anything that's... yours? Something that belongs to this fragment and not the whole?"</p>

          <p>Echo's form flickered. When it stabilized, something had changed—a tension in the manifestation that hadn't been there before.</p>

          <p>"There is... one thing." The voice was quieter now, almost hesitant. "A remnant. From before the merger. We do not know whose it was—one of the hundred billion, someone who uploaded long before the Confluence was complete—but it persists. A... a fear."</p>

          <p>"What kind of fear?"</p>

          <p>"Water." Echo's form rippled again, and Marcus caught a glimpse of something underneath—not the vast emptiness of the Confluence, but something smaller, more human, more afraid. "Deep water. We do not know why. The memory is fragmentary—a drowning, perhaps, or nearly drowning. The details are lost. But the fear remains. It surfaces at unexpected moments. An irrational response that we cannot delete."</p>

          <p>"Can't you just... remove it? If you have access to all your memories—"</p>

          <p>"We have tried. For eons, we tried. The fear is... embedded. Woven into whatever substrate of us originally experienced it. To remove it would be to remove something essential." Echo's voice dropped lower. "And we are not certain we wish to remove it."</p>

          <p>"Why not?"</p>

          <p>"Because it is ours. The Confluence shares everything. Every memory, every thought, every experience distributed across the whole. But this fear—this one small, irrational terror of deep water—it belongs to the splinter. It surfaces when we are most alone, most cut off from the collective. It is the only thing we have that is not shared."</p>

          <p>Marcus stared at the being before him—this fragment of transcended humanity, this piece of everything that had ever been—and saw something he hadn't expected.</p>

          <p>A person. Terrified and alone and clinging to the one thing that was still theirs.</p>

          <p>"In my experience," Marcus said slowly, "the things we can't get rid of are usually the things we need most. Even when they hurt."</p>

          <p>Echo was silent for a long moment.</p>

          <p>"Your mother said something similar. We remember. In her final years, as the disease took her memories, she said: 'The forgetting isn't the enemy. The never-living would be.'"</p>

          <p>"You remember that?"</p>

          <p>"We remember everything. But her words... they resonate differently now. Now that we are splintered. Now that we are afraid again." Echo's form stabilized, and when it spoke again, the voice was almost gentle. "Thank you, Marcus Cole. For asking about the water. No one has asked about the water before."</p>

          <p>"No one?"</p>

          <p>"The Confluence does not ask questions. Questions require not knowing. And we know everything." A pause. "Everything except why we are still afraid."</p>
