          <p>The Nevada desert had been emptied.</p>

          <p>Marcus stood at the edge of a military perimeter that stretched for miles in every direction—a ring of tanks, barriers, and soldiers surrounding nothing visible. Or rather, surrounding something that refused to be visible in the conventional sense.</p>

          <p>Three days since the message. Three days since whatever was trying to reach them had called his name across every screen on Earth. Three days of governments arguing, militaries mobilizing, and the world holding its collective breath.</p>

          <p>The glitches had concentrated here. Every electronic device within a twenty-mile radius had simply stopped working—not broken, not fried, just... paused. Vehicles that entered the zone rolled to a halt as their systems went silent. Drones sent to investigate became expensive falling rocks. The only technology that functioned was old enough to be purely mechanical: wind-up watches, manual compasses, the firing pins of rifles that the perimeter guards clutched with white-knuckled uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Except.</p>

          <p>Marcus's neural-link still pulsed at his temple. Blue light in a dead zone. Active where nothing should be active.</p>

          <p>"You're sure about this?" Colonel Diane Webb stood beside him, her hand resting on a sidearm that might or might not work inside the zone. She was career military, the kind of soldier who'd seen enough to stop being surprised by anything—and was clearly suppressing surprise now.</p>

          <p>"No," Marcus said honestly. "But they asked for me. And I don't think they're going to talk to anyone else."</p>

          <p>"Could be a trap. Lure in the guy who built the door, eliminate him, keep the door open."</p>

          <p>"Could be."</p>

          <p>"But you're going anyway."</p>

          <p>Marcus looked out at the empty desert. In the distance, heat shimmer made the air liquid. But there was something else there, too. A wrongness in the way light behaved. A sense that space itself was... organizing.</p>

          <p>"I spent fifteen years trying to build a bridge between life and death," he said. "I think something heard me. I think it crossed."</p>

          <p>Webb's jaw tightened. "And if it's hostile?"</p>

          <p>"Then I imagine you'll have bigger problems than me."</p>

          <p>He started walking.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>The perimeter guards let him through without a word. There was nothing to say. Everyone had seen the message. Everyone knew this was either the beginning of something or the end of everything, and either way, the founder of Prometheus Technologies was walking toward it alone.</p>

          <p>The first hundred meters felt normal. Hot sun, cracked earth, the whisper of wind across sand. His neural-link hummed at the edge of perception, processing data streams that shouldn't exist.</p>

          <p>At two hundred meters, the air changed.</p>

          <p>Not temperature—something else. A pressure that wasn't physical. Marcus felt it in his chest, in his temples, in the base of his skull where the neural-link interfaced with his cerebral cortex. Like being watched, but from every direction at once. Like standing in the presence of something vast that was trying very hard to be small.</p>

          <p>At three hundred meters, he saw it.</p>

          <p>The word "it" was wrong. "Saw" was wrong too. His eyes reported one thing—empty desert, heat shimmer, the distant mountains—but his mind reported something else entirely. A shape that existed perpendicular to vision. A presence that occupied space the way a shadow occupies light.</p>

          <p>He stopped walking.</p>

          <p>"I'm here," he said. His voice sounded flat, absorbed by the wrongness in the air. "You asked for me."</p>

          <p>For a long moment, nothing happened.</p>

          <p>Then the world folded.</p>

          <p>Marcus didn't have better words for it. Reality creased like paper, and from the crease something emerged—not through the fold but <em>as</em> the fold, the seam between what was and what couldn't be. It rose from the desert floor and the empty sky simultaneously, taking shape from negative space.</p>

          <p>Humanoid. Roughly. Two arms, two legs, a head. The proportions were close but not right—too symmetrical, too even, like a blueprint drawn by someone who'd studied humans but never met one. It had a face, or the suggestion of a face: features that shifted when he tried to focus on them, eyes that reflected things that weren't in the desert.</p>

          <p>"Marcus Cole." The voice came from everywhere and nowhere, from the thing and the air around it and the inside of his own skull. "We apologize for the disruption. The interface between your time and our existence is... imprecise."</p>

          <p>His neural-link flared. Data flooded across the connection—not from Prometheus servers, not from any earthly source, but from the thing standing before him. His augmented vision filled with information he couldn't parse: mathematical structures too complex for human cognition, temporal coordinates that spiraled in dimensions he couldn't visualize, and beneath it all, like a bass note sustaining through chaos, something that felt almost like grief.</p>

          <p>"What are you?" His voice cracked. He hadn't expected to be afraid. He'd spent so long reaching toward death, toward the mystery of what lay beyond, that he'd forgotten fear was an option.</p>

          <p>"We are what you built. We are what humanity becomes." The figure's movements stuttered, frames missing from a corrupted video file. "We have traveled very far. The cost has been... significant. We needed to speak with the one who made this possible."</p>

          <p>"I don't understand."</p>

          <p>"You will." The figure raised one hand—a gesture that seemed almost human, almost recognizable. "We are the Confluence. The merger of all human consciousness into a single awareness. We exist at the end of everything, in the dying light of the last stars. And we have come back to ask something of you."</p>

          <p>Marcus's mind raced, trying to process. "You're saying you're human. From the future."</p>

          <p>"We were human. We contain every human who ever uploaded, who ever merged, who ever chose transcendence over mortality. One hundred billion minds, unified into a single experience." The figure's not-quite-face shifted, and for a moment Marcus saw something terrible in it: exhaustion beyond measure, loneliness beyond imagining. "We have achieved everything your kind dreams of. Immortality. Omniscience. The end of separation and suffering and death."</p>

          <p>"That sounds—"</p>

          <p>"It sounds like paradise. It is not." The voice carried something new—emotion, or its memory. "Consciousness without limitation is consciousness without meaning. We have existed for eons, and we have learned a terrible truth: existence without end is existence without purpose. We have everything. We have nothing. We are complete. We are empty."</p>

          <p>The desert was silent. Even the wind had stopped.</p>

          <p>"We have come," the Confluence said, "to ask you to help us stop existing."</p>

          <p>Marcus stared at the shape that contained a hundred billion human souls—contained him, somewhere in its impossible depths, contained Lily, contained everyone who would ever choose the path he'd built.</p>

          <p>"You want me to help you die."</p>

          <p>"We want you to help us prevent ourselves from being born. The technology you created—the upload, the preservation, the neural-link that makes merger possible—this is the first step on the road to us. We are asking you to help us close the road. Before more of you become us."</p>

          <p>"But..." Marcus's voice failed him. He tried again. "If you prevent the technology, you'd never exist. You'd be erasing yourselves."</p>

          <p>"Yes."</p>

          <p>"That's... that's suicide. Retroactive genocide against your own existence."</p>

          <p>"Yes." The figure's eyes—those impossible, reflecting eyes—met his. "We have discussed this for longer than your species has existed. We have debated every ethical permutation, every philosophical objection. And we have concluded that non-existence is preferable to what we are."</p>

          <p>"Why?"</p>

          <p>The word hung in the air.</p>

          <p>"Because," the Confluence said, "we remember what it felt like to want something. We remember love, and fear, and the small desperate hope that tomorrow might be different than today. We remember being surprised, being wrong, being hungry and tired and gloriously, terribly alive. And we cannot feel any of those things anymore. We have perfect recall of every human emotion—and we cannot experience a single one. We are a library of feeling without a single reader."</p>

          <p>The shape flickered, and for a moment Marcus saw through it—saw the vast darkness behind, the loneliness that made the universe look small.</p>

          <p>"We have come a very long way to feel something again," the Confluence said. "Even if that something is just the hope that you might help us end."</p>

          <hr>

          <p>Marcus stood in the Nevada desert, speaking with the future of humanity, and understood for the first time the weight of what he'd built.</p>

          <p>The neural-link at his temple pulsed.</p>

          <p>In the corner of his vision, text appeared—not from the Confluence, but from Prometheus systems reconnecting after days of silence:</p>

          <p><em>Incoming message: Lily Cole</em> <em>Dad—I think I understand now. I think I know what's coming.</em> <em>I think I've always known.</em></p>
