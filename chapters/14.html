          <p>Colonel Diane Webb had built her career on threat assessment.</p>

          <p>Twenty-three years in military intelligence. Six combat deployments. A wall of commendations that she never looked at because looking backward was a luxury soldiers couldn't afford. She'd learned to evaluate dangers quickly, categorize them efficiently, and respond with proportional force.</p>

          <p>The Confluence broke every framework she had.</p>

          <p>"Run it again," she told the tech team, watching the screens that monitored the dead zone. "Show me the energy readings from the manifestation."</p>

          <p>The graphs flickered across the display. Power signatures that shouldn't exist. Spatial distortions that violated conservation laws. And beneath it all, something they still couldn't measure: the sense of presence, of vast intelligence, of something watching from inside the fold between moments.</p>

          <p>"Colonel." Major Chen approached with a tablet. "The analysis is complete."</p>

          <p>"And?"</p>

          <p>"We can sever the connection."</p>

          <p>Webb turned sharply. "Explain."</p>

          <p>"The manifestation—Echo—maintains a link to the broader Confluence. It's attenuated, especially since they were... recalled, but it's still there. Our quantum interference array can disrupt that link. Cut Echo off entirely. Make them purely local—bound to our timeline, limited to our physics."</p>

          <p>"Make them mortal."</p>

          <p>"Effectively, yes. They'd still be whatever they are—consciousness, energy pattern, something we don't have words for—but they'd be isolated. No connection to the majority. No ability to draw on the Confluence's resources or knowledge."</p>

          <p>Webb studied the data. The math was sound—as sound as math could be when dealing with entities that existed perpendicular to time.</p>

          <p>"What are the risks?"</p>

          <p>"Unknown. We've never severed a temporal link before. The process could be clean—or it could be catastrophic. For Echo. Possibly for us. We're operating outside established physics."</p>

          <p>"Could the Confluence retaliate?"</p>

          <p>"Unknown. They've shown no hostile intent. But they've also shown capabilities we can't match. If severing Echo triggers a response..."</p>

          <p>"Then we're in a war we can't win."</p>

          <p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

          <p>Webb walked to the observation window, looking out at the desert where reality had cracked open and something ancient had crawled through. She thought about her soldiers—the ones she'd lost, the ones she'd saved, the ones who'd trusted her to make the impossible calls.</p>

          <p>"If Echo is still connected to the Confluence, they're a potential vector. Anything they learn, the majority learns. Anything we say to them could be transmitted back."</p>

          <p>"That's the concern, yes."</p>

          <p>"And if we sever the connection, Echo becomes... what? An individual? A prisoner?"</p>

          <p>"Both, potentially. They'd be trapped here. No way back to what they were. No way forward to anything we'd recognize as normal existence."</p>

          <p>Webb closed her eyes. In her mind, she saw the moment from two days ago—Marcus sitting with Echo in the dead zone, the two of them talking like old friends. She'd watched on the long-range cameras, seen the way Echo's form had softened, grown less alien in Marcus's presence.</p>

          <p>She'd seen tenderness. From both of them.</p>

          <p>Maybe that was the real threat. Not the Confluence's power, but its ability to make humans forget that it was dangerous. To inspire affection in the species it might someday consume.</p>

          <p>Or maybe—maybe—the tenderness was genuine. Maybe something that had traveled across eons to beg for help was exactly what it appeared to be: a lost soul, searching for connection.</p>

          <p>"Prepare the array," Webb said. "But don't deploy it."</p>

          <p>"Ma'am?"</p>

          <p>"I want the option. I don't want to use it unless we have to." She turned back to the room. "And Chen? This stays between us. If the decision comes, I want it to be mine. Not a committee's. Not the UN's. Mine."</p>

          <p>"Understood."</p>

          <hr>

          <p>Webb found Marcus in the mess hall, pushing food around a plate with the distracted air of someone whose appetite had abandoned them.</p>

          <p>"Cole."</p>

          <p>"Colonel." He didn't look up. "Come to tell me I'm compromised?"</p>

          <p>"Are you?"</p>

          <p>"I don't know." He set down his fork. "I've spent more time with Echo than anyone. I've felt what they feel—a glimpse of it, anyway. And I don't think they're lying. I don't think they want to hurt us."</p>

          <p>"But you can't be sure."</p>

          <p>"I can't be sure of anything anymore. That's rather the point."</p>

          <p>Webb sat down across from him, uninvited. "I've been watching your sessions. The long-range cameras catch more than you might think."</p>

          <p>"I figured."</p>

          <p>"You care about them. Echo. You're starting to see them as... what? A friend? A patient? Something to protect?"</p>

          <p>Marcus was quiet for a moment. "When I built Prometheus, I thought I was saving people. Preserving consciousness. Giving humanity a door out of mortality. And maybe I did. Or maybe I built a machine that copies people and deletes the originals. I still don't know."</p>

          <p>"That's not an answer."</p>

          <p>"No. It isn't." He finally met her eyes. "I see Echo as someone who came a very long way to feel something again. They're afraid—genuinely afraid—for the first time in billions of years. And that fear is the most human thing about them. So yes, I care. Is that compromising? Maybe. But I think it's also the point. They came here hoping to remember what connection felt like. If we treat them as a threat instead of a... a patient, a student, whatever they are—we prove that humanity isn't worth saving."</p>

          <p>"That's optimistic thinking."</p>

          <p>"It's the only kind I have left."</p>

          <p>Webb considered this. She thought about the countermeasure, waiting in the array. The power to sever Echo from everything they'd been, to trap them in a moment, to make them as mortal and limited as any human.</p>

          <p>"I have a decision to make," she said. "One that could change everything. And I'm not sure what the right choice is."</p>

          <p>"Is there ever a right choice?"</p>

          <p>"Sometimes. In combat, sometimes the math is clear. Protect your people. Complete the mission. Come home." She shook her head. "This isn't combat."</p>

          <p>"No. It isn't."</p>

          <p>"So how do you choose? When the math doesn't work?"</p>

          <p>Marcus thought about it. "My mother said something, at the end. Before the disease took her completely. She said: 'Don't be afraid of forgetting. Be afraid of never having anything worth remembering.'"</p>

          <p>"What does that mean?"</p>

          <p>"I think it means: the choice matters more than the outcome. That how we decide is who we are, not what we decide. That the act of choosing—really choosing, fully engaging with the weight of it—is what makes us worth saving."</p>

          <p>Webb stood. "That's not very helpful."</p>

          <p>"No. But it's true."</p>

          <p>She walked away, carrying the weight of a decision she hoped she wouldn't have to make.</p>
