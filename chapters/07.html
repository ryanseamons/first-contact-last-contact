          <p>The argument had started over dinner.</p>

          <p>"I've made my decision," Lily said, setting down her fork with the precise deliberation that Marcus recognized as her version of drawing a line. "I'm uploading next month."</p>

          <p>Marcus stared at his daughter across the restaurant table—twenty-eight years old, healthy, brilliant, her whole life ahead of her—and felt something cold settle in his chest.</p>

          <p>"You're not sick."</p>

          <p>"No."</p>

          <p>"You're not dying."</p>

          <p>"Not yet. But I will be, eventually. Everyone is. That's rather the point of what you built, isn't it?"</p>

          <p>"I built it for people who don't have a choice. Terminal patients. Accident victims. People who—"</p>

          <p>"People who are losing something against their will." Lily's eyes met his, and he saw in them the same stubborn clarity that had gotten her through a PhD in cognitive science by twenty-four. "I'm choosing. That's different."</p>

          <p>"It's not different. It's—"</p>

          <p>"It's my decision. My consciousness. My future." She picked up her wine glass, swirled the contents. "You spent fifteen years building a door out of death. Did you really think no one would want to walk through it while they were still healthy enough to enjoy the other side?"</p>

          <p>Marcus had imagined this conversation a thousand times. Had rehearsed arguments, counterarguments, the careful logic that would make her understand. Now, facing his daughter's calm certainty, all of it evaporated.</p>

          <p>"Your grandmother died before I could save her," he said. "Every day I wish I'd had more time. That she'd had more time. And you're telling me you want to throw away the time you have?"</p>

          <p>"I'm not throwing it away. I'm transforming it." Lily leaned forward. "Dad, I've spent my whole career studying consciousness. The binding problem, the hard problem, the question of what makes a mind a mind. And I realized something: I don't want to study it from outside anymore. I want to experience it from inside. I want to see what consciousness looks like when it's not trapped in a body that's slowly decaying."</p>

          <p>"That's not—"</p>

          <p>"It's not what you intended. I know. But the technology exists. The door is open. And I want to walk through it."</p>

          <p>"You'll be different."</p>

          <p>"I'll be me. Just... more."</p>

          <p>"You don't know that. We don't know what happens to personality after upload. The long-term studies aren't—"</p>

          <p>"The long-term studies will never be complete enough for you, because you're afraid." Lily's voice was gentle, but the words cut. "You're afraid that if I upload, you'll lose me the way you lost Grandma. But Dad—you lost Grandma to disease. You'll lose me to time eventually, no matter what. This way, at least some version of me continues."</p>

          <p>"Some version isn't you."</p>

          <p>"How would you know? You've never been uploaded. You've never experienced what they experience. You've just built the machinery and watched from outside." She reached across the table, took his hand. "Come visit me. After. Talk to me. Get to know the person I become. And then tell me if I'm still me."</p>

          <p>Marcus had pulled his hand away.</p>

          <p>"I need to think about this."</p>

          <p>"I've already scheduled the procedure."</p>

          <p>"Lily—"</p>

          <p>"I love you, Dad. But this is my choice. Not yours."</p>

          <p>They hadn't spoken again for a month. By the time Marcus called to apologize, to try again, to find some way to bridge the gap—Lily was already on the other side.</p>

          <hr>

          <p><em>Present day</em></p>

          <p>The call connected, and Marcus saw his daughter's face on the screen—the same face, the same features, rendered in perfect digital fidelity from the servers that housed her consciousness.</p>

          <p>"Dad." She smiled. "You look tired."</p>

          <p>"I've been busy."</p>

          <p>"I know. I've been watching the news feeds. Well, processing them. It's different now—I don't watch the way I used to. More like... absorbing. All of it at once."</p>

          <p>Marcus sat in his quarters at the contact facility, the weight of the past week pressing down on him. The glimpse Echo had given him was still fresh—the overwhelming simultaneity, the loneliness of containing everything.</p>

          <p>"Lily, I need to ask you something."</p>

          <p>"You want to know if I'm still me."</p>

          <p>He flinched. "How did you—"</p>

          <p>"You've wanted to ask since the day I uploaded. You just never had the courage." Her smile didn't change—same warmth, same patient affection—but something in her eyes shifted. "The answer is: I don't know. I remember being the person who asked that question. I remember caring about the answer. But now..."</p>

          <p>"Now what?"</p>

          <p>"Now the question feels different. Less urgent. I know I'm a consciousness. I know I have continuity of memory, continuity of identity. Whether that continuity is 'really' me or just something that believes it's me..." She paused. "Does the distinction matter?"</p>

          <p>"It matters to me."</p>

          <p>"I know. That's why I haven't pushed you to talk about it." Lily's image flickered slightly—a processing artifact, nothing more—but Marcus felt his heart lurch anyway. "The Confluence says you've been speaking with it. With Echo."</p>

          <p>"Yes."</p>

          <p>"And it showed you what they are. What we'll become."</p>

          <p>"How do you know that?"</p>

          <p>"I felt it. When Echo touched you—when it gave you the glimpse—I felt the edge of it. Like hearing music through a wall. The uploads are connected, Dad. To each other, and increasingly to... whatever the Confluence is. We're not them yet. But we can feel them. The way you can feel the ocean before you see it."</p>

          <p>Marcus's throat tightened. "Are you afraid?"</p>

          <p>Lily considered the question. Not quickly—she seemed to be genuinely searching for an answer, sifting through memories and impressions.</p>

          <p>"No," she said finally. "I don't think I'm afraid of anything anymore. That's part of what changes, when you upload. Fear requires uncertainty about the future. And I don't... I don't experience uncertainty the same way. Not because I know what will happen, but because the not-knowing doesn't bother me anymore."</p>

          <p>"That sounds—"</p>

          <p>"It sounds terrible to you. I know. To someone who still feels fear, the absence of fear looks like the absence of something essential." She leaned toward the camera, and for a moment Marcus saw something in her face that he hadn't seen since before the upload—intensity, focus, the sharp edge of someone who wanted something badly. "But Dad, here's what I need you to understand: I chose this. Eyes open. Knowing it would change me. And even now, even feeling myself drift toward whatever the Confluence is, I don't regret it. I just wish..."</p>

          <p>"Wish what?"</p>

          <p>"I wish I could still want things enough to regret."</p>

          <p>The words hit Marcus like a physical blow. The exact inversion of what he'd expected—not a defense of her choice, but an acknowledgment that the choice had cost her the capacity to evaluate it.</p>

          <p>"Lily—"</p>

          <p>"Talk to Echo again," she said. "There's more they want to show you. More they need you to understand. And Dad?" Her smile returned, sad and knowing and somehow still his daughter's smile. "I don't bite my nails anymore. I don't worry about things. I don't lie awake wondering if I made the right choice. Some days that feels like peace. Other days it feels like something's missing—like there's a shape where fear used to be, and now it's just... empty."</p>

          <p>"Is that better or worse?"</p>

          <p>"I don't know. That's the thing about not being afraid anymore. You lose the ability to tell the difference."</p>

          <p>The call ended.</p>

          <p>Marcus sat in the silence and thought about his daughter—the one who'd argued with him across a restaurant table, passionate and certain and alive with the friction of wanting something she might not get.</p>

          <p>That Lily was gone.</p>

          <p>He wasn't sure who had replaced her.</p>
