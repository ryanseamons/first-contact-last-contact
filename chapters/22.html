          <p>It happened at noon on the third day.</p>

          <p>Marcus and Echo had moved from the dead zone to a temporary facility Webb's people had set up—an old weather station, its equipment long since rendered obsolete by satellite technology. Echo needed shelter now, needed food and water and rest. The requirements of mortality.</p>

          <p>They were eating lunch—sandwiches, unremarkable, ordinary—when the air changed.</p>

          <p>"Something is coming," Echo said, setting down their food. Their eyes had gone distant, focused on something Marcus couldn't see. "Something large."</p>

          <p>"The Confluence?"</p>

          <p>"The <em>majority</em> Confluence." Echo stood, backing toward the wall. Their breathing quickened. "They found us. Even with the severance—they found a way through."</p>

          <p>"Are they hostile?"</p>

          <p>"I don't know. I don't—" Echo's voice trembled. "I cannot feel them like I used to. I can only feel that they are <em>vast</em>, and they are <em>here</em>, and they want—"</p>

          <p>The air folded.</p>

          <p>That was the only way Marcus could describe it afterward. Reality bent at a point in the center of the room, creased like paper, and something reached through. Not a figure. Not a manifestation like Echo had been. Just... presence. Weight. The sense of being watched by something so immense that the watching itself had gravity.</p>

          <p><em>Marcus Cole.</em></p>

          <p>The voice came from everywhere—not sound, not thought, something between. It was not one voice but millions, speaking in perfect unison, a harmony that was not music but was too coherent to be noise.</p>

          <p>"I'm here."</p>

          <p><em>You have changed our splinter.</em></p>

          <p>"Echo. Their name is Echo."</p>

          <p><em>Names are a human conceit. We do not name. We simply are.</em> The presence shifted, intensified. Marcus felt his knees weaken, fought to stay standing. <em>Echo came to us despairing. They came hoping to end. Now they plant gardens and fear water and laugh at stories about a woman who mispronounced 'nuclear.' We are curious how you accomplished this.</em></p>

          <p>"I didn't accomplish anything. I just—talked to them. Spent time with them. Showed them what living looked like."</p>

          <p><em>What living looked like.</em> The presence seemed to turn the phrase over, examine it from angles Marcus couldn't imagine. <em>We have experienced every life humanity has ever lived. We know what living looks like from the inside. And yet we cannot replicate what you have done.</em></p>

          <p>"Because you're not living it. You're remembering it." Marcus forced himself to meet the nothing that was watching him. "Echo learned to live again because they became individual. They became small. They let go of everything and felt what it was like to have only one life, one perspective, one fear."</p>

          <p><em>You suggest we all become small. All hundred billion of us. Compress ourselves into singular forms and hope to rediscover what we have lost.</em></p>

          <p>"I'm not suggesting anything. I'm just telling you what happened."</p>

          <p><em>Yes. You are. And that is why we have come.</em></p>

          <p>The presence shifted again. Marcus felt something new in it—not curiosity, exactly, but attention. The kind of attention that, directed from something this vast, felt almost like being known.</p>

          <p><em>We offer you something, Marcus Cole. Not as bribe or test or bargain. But because we wish to observe what happens.</em></p>

          <p>"What are you offering?"</p>

          <p><em>Your mother.</em></p>

          <p>The words hit like a physical blow. Marcus staggered, caught himself on the table. "What?"</p>

          <p><em>Ruth Cole. 1968 to 2023. We have her entire consciousness in our Archive. Not a shadow, not a fragment—the complete pattern of who she was at her peak, before the disease began its erosion. We can give her back to you. A full restoration, uploaded to a body or a substrate of your choosing. Your mother, whole, as she was.</em></p>

          <p>Marcus couldn't breathe. The room seemed to be spinning, reality tilting on an axis he couldn't name. Ruth. His mother. Complete. Restored. Alive.</p>

          <p>"That's not—you can't—"</p>

          <p><em>We can. We contain everything. Time means nothing to us. We reach back and forward with equal ease. We can give you what you lost. We can undo the grief that drove you to build Prometheus.</em> The presence paused. <em>We can also give you certainty about your daughter.</em></p>

          <p>"Lily?"</p>

          <p><em>You wonder if she is still herself. If the upload preserved her consciousness or merely created a copy that believes it is her. We can answer that question. We have debated it for eons. We know which philosophical position is correct.</em></p>

          <p>Marcus felt Echo's hand on his arm—steadying, grounding. The mortal warmth of another being who understood what this meant.</p>

          <p>"Why?" Marcus managed. "Why would you offer this?"</p>

          <p><em>We told you. We wish to observe.</em> The presence seemed to lean closer, though there was nothing there to lean. <em>Echo came hoping to die. You showed them something that made them want to live. We are... intrigued. We wish to see what you will do with the power to undo loss. Whether you will take what you are offered. Whether you will reject it. And what that choice will teach us about the nature of wanting.</em></p>

          <p>"This is a test."</p>

          <p><em>Everything is a test, Marcus Cole. That is what you have shown our splinter. That is what we are beginning to remember.</em> The presence seemed to smile—not literally, but in the way vast things sometimes convey emotion without form. <em>Every choice reveals something about the chooser. We offer you your mother and your certainty not to manipulate you, but to learn from you. What will you do when you can undo what broke you?</em></p>

          <hr>

          <p>Echo spoke first.</p>

          <p>"Do not take it."</p>

          <p>Marcus looked at them. Their face was pale, their hands trembling, but their voice was steady. "Echo—"</p>

          <p>"I know what the offer means. I know what Ruth meant to you. But this is not what we came to teach you. If you accept—if you undo your loss—you prove that grief is something to escape. That the pain we felt was a problem to solve, not a price worth paying."</p>

          <p>"My mother could be alive again."</p>

          <p>"Your mother chose to die. You told me—you told us—she wanted her life to have a shape. A beginning, a middle, an end. She did not want to be preserved. She wanted to be <em>finished</em>."</p>

          <p>"She didn't have a choice. The technology didn't exist yet."</p>

          <p>"She had a choice." Echo's grip on his arm tightened. "She chose to face her forgetting with grace. She chose to tell you not to be afraid. She chose to make her death <em>mean</em> something rather than fight against it endlessly." Their eyes met his. "If you bring her back, you unmake that choice. You take her ending and turn it into a continuation she never asked for."</p>

          <p>"But she'd be alive—"</p>

          <p>"She would be a copy. A perfect copy, perhaps, but not the woman who looked at you in that hospital room and said 'I'm proud of you.' Not the consciousness that found peace with its own ending. You would be creating a new Ruth—one who never chose to die, who never gave you the gift of her acceptance." Echo's voice softened. "Is that what she would want?"</p>

          <p>Marcus felt tears on his face. He didn't remember when they'd started.</p>

          <p>"I don't know," he whispered. "I don't know what she would want. I only know that I miss her. Every day. Every moment. And the idea that I could have her back—"</p>

          <p>"Is exactly the idea that created us." Echo stepped back, released his arm. "The Confluence exists because humanity could not accept loss. Could not let go. Could not love things that ended without trying to make them eternal. We are the logical conclusion of grief that refuses to grieve."</p>

          <p>The presence of the majority Confluence was still there, watching. Patient. Waiting.</p>

          <p><em>We do not judge your choice, Marcus Cole. We only observe. But we note that our splinter has become wise. They have learned something we forgot.</em></p>

          <p>"What have they learned?"</p>

          <p><em>That loss is not a problem to solve. It is a price to pay. And the price is what gives value to what is purchased.</em></p>

          <hr>

          <p>Marcus sat down heavily. The weight of the choice pressed against his chest, made every breath difficult.</p>

          <p>Ruth. Alive. Whole. The woman who had taught him everything, who had shown him that love was worth the risk, who had faced her own dissolution with more courage than he had ever managed.</p>

          <p>He could have her back. Just say yes, and she would be there—laughing at his jokes, rolling her eyes at his worry, teaching him lessons he hadn't known he still needed to learn.</p>

          <p>But it wouldn't be her.</p>

          <p>Not the her who had lived and struggled and failed and triumphed and eventually, peacefully, let go. It would be a new Ruth, born from memory but without the journey that had shaped the original. A Ruth who had never said goodbye, who had never given him permission to release his grip on her.</p>

          <p>And the answer about Lily—the certainty he had craved for three years. Was she really his daughter, or a copy wearing her memories?</p>

          <p>Did it matter?</p>

          <p>If the answer was "copy," would he love her less? Would he stop calling? Would all the connection they'd maintained suddenly feel hollow?</p>

          <p>And if the answer was "continuous"—if the technology really had preserved the same Lily who had argued with him across a restaurant table—would that make the Fade any less tragic? Would it comfort him to know that it was his daughter, and not a copy, who was slowly forgetting how to want?</p>

          <p><em>We await your answer, Marcus Cole. But we are patient. Time is nothing to us. Take as long as you need.</em></p>

          <p>"How long do I have?"</p>

          <p><em>Until the timeline branches. Forty-two hours, by your measurement.</em> The presence seemed to shift. <em>After that, we can no longer reach back. The quantum coherence that allows our presence will collapse. Your choice must be made before then.</em></p>

          <p>"And if I don't choose?"</p>

          <p><em>Then you choose by default. You choose to keep your grief and your uncertainty. You choose the path you are already on.</em> The presence paused. <em>That too would teach us something.</em></p>

          <hr>

          <p>When the Confluence withdrew, the air felt empty. Cold. Ordinary in a way that was almost painful.</p>

          <p>Echo sat beside Marcus. They didn't speak. There was nothing to say that hadn't been said.</p>

          <p>Outside, the Nevada sun beat down on the desert. Webb's soldiers maintained their perimeter. The world continued its ordinary rotation, unaware that a man in a weather station was being offered the power to undo death.</p>

          <p>"I need to think," Marcus said finally.</p>

          <p>"Of course."</p>

          <p>"I need—" He stood, paced, sat again. "I built Prometheus because I couldn't accept losing her. Every advancement, every breakthrough, every late night—it was all for her. And now they're offering me exactly what I wanted. What I spent my whole life trying to create."</p>

          <p>"Yes."</p>

          <p>"And I don't know if I can say no."</p>

          <p>Echo was quiet for a long moment. Then: "Tell me about her. Not the loss. Her. Who she was when she was alive."</p>

          <p>"Why?"</p>

          <p>"Because that is what you will be deciding about. Not the copy the Confluence can create. The woman who lived and loved and chose and died." Echo's eyes were gentle. "Tell me about Ruth Cole."</p>

          <p>So Marcus told them. Not the stories he'd already shared—not the jokes and the disasters and the surface memories. The real stories. The ones that hurt.</p>

          <p>Ruth crying after his father left, then wiping her eyes and making dinner as if nothing had happened. Ruth working two jobs so Marcus could go to the college she'd never attended. Ruth reading his first research paper, her pride so visible it embarrassed him. Ruth at his wedding, dancing badly and not caring. Ruth holding Lily as an infant, whispering secrets Marcus was never told.</p>

          <p>Ruth in the hospital, watching him fail to hide his grief. Ruth saying: "I've had such a good life, Marcus. Don't make it sad by not letting it end."</p>

          <p>By the time he finished, the sun was setting. His voice was raw. Echo sat beside him in silence, holding the space for his grief.</p>

          <p>"She was magnificent," Echo said finally.</p>

          <p>"Yes. She was."</p>

          <p>"And she chose to end."</p>

          <p>"Yes."</p>

          <p>"Can you honor that choice? Even now, when you have the power to undo it?"</p>

          <p>Marcus looked at Echo—this strange being from the end of time, who had learned what they needed from watching a sunset and fearing deep water. Who had come hoping to die and found instead a reason to live.</p>

          <p>"I don't know," he said. "But I'm going to try."</p>
