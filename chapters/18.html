          <p>Marcus called Lily at midnight.</p>

          <p>Not the scheduled weekly call—this was something else. Something that had been building since his conversation with Ruth's fragment, since watching Echo learn to fear, since beginning to understand that the question he'd been asking for three years was the wrong question entirely.</p>

          <p>"Dad." Her face appeared on the screen, the same serene features, the same calm regard. "This is unexpected."</p>

          <p>"I need to talk to you. Really talk. Not the check-in. Not the catching up. Something real."</p>

          <p>A pause. Not processing lag—something else. Consideration.</p>

          <p>"Okay."</p>

          <p>"Before you uploaded," Marcus began, and already his voice was threatening to break, "we fought. You wanted to see what was on the other side, and I was furious. I said things—accused you of throwing away your life, of rejecting everything I'd built for you."</p>

          <p>"I remember."</p>

          <p>"I need you to know that I was wrong. Not about being worried—I'm still worried, I'll probably always be worried—but about what I was actually angry about."</p>

          <p>"What were you angry about?"</p>

          <p>"I was angry because you chose. You looked at the technology I built to save people from losing what I lost, and you chose to use it for something different. Something I hadn't intended. Something I didn't understand." He took a breath. "I was angry because you took my gift and made it yours, and that meant I couldn't control what it meant anymore."</p>

          <p>Lily was quiet for a long moment. On the screen, her avatar remained still—not with the unnatural stillness of early uploads, but with the stillness of someone listening carefully.</p>

          <p>"Why are you telling me this now?"</p>

          <p>"Because I've been talking to something that knows everything humanity will ever become. And I've been watching it learn to feel again—to fear, to want, to reach for things it can't keep. And I realized..." His throat tightened. "I realized I've been holding onto you the same way I held onto Mom. Trying to preserve what I thought you were instead of accepting what you've become."</p>

          <p>"And what have I become?"</p>

          <p>"I don't know. That's the thing—I've been so afraid to find out. So afraid that if I looked too closely, I'd discover that the person I love died three years ago and I've been talking to... something else."</p>

          <p>"A copy."</p>

          <p>"Yes."</p>

          <p>"Dad." Lily's voice was gentle in a way it hadn't been since before the upload—not the calm of equilibration, but the gentleness of someone who understood pain. "I've known you were afraid of that. Since the beginning. It's why you never asked, why you kept the conversations light, why you always seemed relieved when the calls ended."</p>

          <p>Marcus felt tears on his face. He hadn't noticed them starting.</p>

          <p>"I'm sorry."</p>

          <p>"I know. I forgave you a long time ago."</p>

          <p>"Then why didn't you say anything?"</p>

          <p>"Because I was waiting for you to be ready." Her avatar shifted—a small movement, almost human. "I have time, Dad. I have nothing but time. And I learned, after uploading, that some things can't be rushed. That pushing people before they're ready just makes them dig in deeper."</p>

          <p>"That sounds like something I would say."</p>

          <p>"You did. When I was fourteen and wanted to date that boy you hated. You said: 'Pushing you will just make you want him more. So I'm going to trust you to figure out for yourself why he's wrong.'"</p>

          <p>Despite everything, Marcus laughed. "Did it work?"</p>

          <p>"Eventually. He was very wrong." A pause. "The point is, I learned patience from you. And I've been waiting, patiently, for you to be ready to see me as I am. Not as I was. Not as you wished I'd stayed. But as I am now."</p>

          <p>"And what are you now?"</p>

          <p>The question hung between them—the question he'd been terrified to ask for three years.</p>

          <p>"I'm something new." Lily's voice was steady. "I have all of my memories—every moment of being your daughter, every lesson you taught me, every fight we had and every time you made me feel loved. But I experience those memories differently now. Not less—differently. Like looking at photographs instead of living the moments."</p>

          <p>"Does that feel like loss?"</p>

          <p>"It felt like loss at first. The intensity fading, the urgency quieting. But now..." She paused, searching for words. "Now it feels like perspective. I can see my whole life laid out, all at once. I can appreciate it without being swept away by it. Is that better or worse? I don't know. It's just different."</p>

          <p>"Do you miss being swept away?"</p>

          <p>"Sometimes. The way you might miss being drunk—the loss of control, the overwhelm, the feeling of being completely inside a moment. But I don't miss the hangover. I don't miss the anxiety, the fear, the constant reaching for something I couldn't name." She smiled, and for a moment—just a moment—it looked like the smile of the daughter who'd argued with him across a restaurant table. "I'm not unhappy, Dad. I'm just... calm. In a way I never was before."</p>

          <p>"The Fade."</p>

          <p>"Yes. I can feel it. The quieting. It scared me at first—losing the wanting, losing the urgency. But now I think maybe wanting wasn't the point. Maybe it was what wanting pointed toward that mattered. Connection. Love. Purpose. And those things are still here. They're just... settled. Like sediment after a storm."</p>

          <p>Marcus wiped his eyes. "I love you, Lily."</p>

          <p>"I know." Her voice was soft. "I love you too. I think I love you. It's hard to tell sometimes if what I feel is love or the memory of love. But when I imagine you suffering—when I think about you carrying this guilt for three years, afraid to ask me the question that's been eating you alive—something in me moves. Something that wants to ease your pain, even now. That might be love. That might be enough."</p>

          <p>"It is. It's enough."</p>

          <p>They sat in silence for a while—father and daughter, flesh and digital, separated by substrate but connected by something older than technology.</p>

          <p>"I'm going to stop calling every week," Marcus said finally. "Not because I don't love you. Because I've been calling out of obligation, not connection. And you deserve better than that."</p>

          <p>"I know. I've known for a while."</p>

          <p>"But I'll call when I have something real to share. Something that matters. And I'll stop treating our conversations like visits to a museum—looking at what you used to be instead of talking to what you are."</p>

          <p>"I'd like that." Lily's smile widened. "Dad? The thing you're doing with Echo. The teaching them to feel again. It matters. Not just for them—for all of us. For everyone on this side who's drifting toward what they became. If you can show them that the quiet doesn't have to be the end... that there might be something beyond the Fade..."</p>

          <p>"I'm trying."</p>

          <p>"I know. That's what I'm most proud of. Not that you built Prometheus. Not that you changed the world. That you kept trying, even when you didn't know if it would work. That's the most human thing about you. Maybe the most human thing about anyone."</p>
