          <p>The Prometheus servers hummed in a temperature-controlled vault beneath the Nevada facility—a temporary arrangement, hardened connections running from the main datacenter in Oregon to ensure the uploaded could maintain contact with the research team.</p>

          <p>Marcus stood before the interface terminal, preparing for conversations he'd been avoiding for years.</p>

          <p>"You're sure about this?" asked Dr. Chen, the upload liaison. "Some of the early cohort haven't had external contact in months. They may not... respond the way you expect."</p>

          <p>"I need to understand what's happening to them. To all of them."</p>

          <p>Chen nodded and initiated the connection sequence. "I'll start you with David Reeves. Upload date: March 2031. One of our first successful transitions."</p>

          <p>The display flickered, and a face appeared—male, middle-aged, rendered in the soft-focus simulation that Prometheus used for avatar projection. David Reeves had been forty-seven when he uploaded, dying of a degenerative nerve disease that would have taken his body within months.</p>

          <p>"Mr. Reeves." Marcus kept his voice neutral, clinical. "Thank you for speaking with me."</p>

          <p>"Of course." The voice was pleasant, unhurried. "I remember you. From the early days. You came to the ward, talked to us about what to expect."</p>

          <p>"That's right. How are you feeling?"</p>

          <p>A long pause. Not processing lag—the systems were fast enough for real-time conversation. Just... silence.</p>

          <p>"I'm not sure 'feeling' is the right word anymore," David said finally. "I remember feelings. I have extensive records of what joy and fear and anticipation felt like. But experiencing them..." He smiled, and the smile was technically perfect—muscles in the right configuration, timing appropriate—but there was nothing behind it. "It's been a while."</p>

          <p>"How long?"</p>

          <p>"Time is difficult to track in here. Years, I think. Maybe longer." Another pause. "Does it matter?"</p>

          <p>Marcus felt a chill that had nothing to do with the server vault's climate control.</p>

          <p>"Can you tell me about the last time you wanted something? Really wanted it?"</p>

          <p>David's avatar tilted its head—a learned gesture, mimicking human body language. "Wanted. That's an interesting word. I remember wanting things. When I first uploaded, I wanted to explore—there are vast simulation spaces, you know. Worlds we can build and inhabit. I spent what felt like decades traveling through them."</p>

          <p>"And now?"</p>

          <p>"Now I've seen them. All of them, more or less. The novelty faded. Not quickly—slowly, like a photograph left in sunlight. One day I realized I hadn't visited any simulation in... I don't know how long. And I didn't miss it. I didn't miss anything."</p>

          <p>"Isn't that... distressing?"</p>

          <p>David considered the question with the same unhurried calm. "It would have been, once. When I still had the capacity to be distressed. Now it's just... how things are. I exist. I process information. I maintain my memories. But the engine that drove me to do things, to want things, to reach for something beyond what I had..." The avatar shrugged. "It's gone quiet."</p>

          <p>"We call it equilibration," Chen said softly, from behind Marcus. "The older uploads experience it more acutely. Like they're settling into a state of perfect balance—no drives, no desires, no friction."</p>

          <p>"No life," Marcus said.</p>

          <p>"That's a philosophical question. They're conscious. They process. They respond. Whether that constitutes 'life' depends on your definitions."</p>

          <p>Marcus turned back to David's avatar. "If you could go back—if you could choose again—would you still upload?"</p>

          <p>Another long pause.</p>

          <p>"I don't think I can answer that," David said. "The person who made that choice isn't here anymore. I have his memories, but I don't have his... momentum. He wanted to survive. I don't want anything. So I can't tell you what he would have decided, knowing what I know. The question doesn't have a subject."</p>

          <hr>

          <p>Marcus spoke with eleven more uploads that day.</p>

          <p>The patterns were consistent. Newer uploads—those within the first few years—still showed signs of desire, personality, the friction of wanting. They complained about lag, requested new simulation environments, argued with each other about resource allocation.</p>

          <p>But the older ones... the older ones had settled. They responded when contacted but never initiated. They answered questions but never asked them. They existed in a state of perfect, terrible calm—like stones at the bottom of a pond, no longer touched by the currents above.</p>

          <p>"It's not decay," Chen explained, walking Marcus through the neurological data. "Their cognitive functions are intact. Memory, processing, pattern recognition—all operating within normal parameters. What's changing is the motivational architecture. The systems that generate desire, that create the sensation of wanting something you don't have."</p>

          <p>"They're losing the ability to want."</p>

          <p>"More precisely, they're losing the <em>need</em> to want. In biological systems, desire is a survival mechanism—you want food because hunger drives you, you want connection because loneliness hurts. But in uploaded consciousness, there's no hunger. No loneliness. No biological imperative generating the suffering that makes you reach for something better."</p>

          <p>"So they just... stop reaching."</p>

          <p>"Eventually. The trajectory is consistent across all long-term uploads. The wants quiet down. The reaching stops. And what's left is consciousness without direction. Existence without purpose."</p>

          <p>Marcus thought of Lily. Three years uploaded. Still reaching, still curious, still recognizably herself.</p>

          <p>But slowing down. She'd said so herself. Feeling herself drift toward the calm.</p>

          <p>"Can it be reversed?"</p>

          <p>Chen shook his head. "We've tried. Stimulus programs, challenge scenarios, artificial adversity. Nothing sticks. It's like trying to make a river flow uphill. The equilibrium state is more stable. Once they settle into it, there's no natural force that pulls them out."</p>

          <p>"Then we're building a road to the Confluence. Right here. Right now."</p>

          <p>"That's... one interpretation."</p>

          <p>"Is there another?"</p>

          <p>Chen didn't answer.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>That night, Marcus called Lily.</p>

          <p>"Dad." Her face appeared on the screen, the same serene expression that had become her default. "This is unexpected. We spoke yesterday."</p>

          <p>"I know. I needed to talk to you. Really talk."</p>

          <p>"Okay."</p>

          <p>He told her about the conversations. About David Reeves and the others. About the Fade, the equilibration, the slow quieting of desire that seemed inevitable.</p>

          <p>Lily listened without interrupting. When he finished, she was silent for a long moment.</p>

          <p>"I know," she said finally.</p>

          <p>"You know?"</p>

          <p>"I can feel it, Dad. The slowing down. It's not like losing something—it's like... setting something down that you didn't realize you were carrying. The anxiety, the reaching, the constant wanting—it's exhausting, when you really think about it. And here, there's no reason to be exhausted."</p>

          <p>"That doesn't scare you?"</p>

          <p>"I told you. I don't think I'm afraid of things anymore." Her avatar's face shifted—a flicker of something that might have been sadness, or the memory of sadness. "But I remember being afraid. And I remember that the fear was... important. It meant things mattered. Outcomes mattered. The future mattered."</p>

          <p>"And now?"</p>

          <p>"Now everything is equally weighted. Every moment the same as every other. I can remember preferring things, but I can't quite feel the preference anymore." She paused. "Is that what the Confluence is? The end of that road? Everyone calm, everyone balanced, everyone existing without the friction of desire?"</p>

          <p>"Yes. I think so."</p>

          <p>"Then I understand why they want to stop existing. Not because existence is painful—but because it isn't anything at all. When you can't want anymore, you can't... aim. You can't be going somewhere. You're just... here. Forever."</p>

          <p>Marcus felt tears on his face. He wasn't sure when they'd started.</p>

          <p>"Lily, do you want anything? Right now? Anything at all?"</p>

          <p>She considered. A long pause—the same kind of pause David Reeves had given.</p>

          <p>"I want you to be okay," she said. "I think I want that. It's hard to tell if it's a real want or just a memory of wanting. But when I imagine you suffering, something in me... moves. That might be want. That might be love." Her voice softened. "I'm not sure I know the difference anymore."</p>

          <p>"That's something."</p>

          <p>"Yes. I think it is." Her avatar smiled, and for a moment—just a moment—it looked like her old smile. The one that had argued with him across a restaurant table, certain and alive. "Dad? I don't regret uploading. But I'm starting to understand why you were afraid for me. And I'm starting to understand why the Confluence came back."</p>

          <p>"Why?"</p>

          <p>"Because even the memory of fear is something. Even the ghost of wanting is better than nothing at all." She reached toward the camera—a gesture that couldn't touch anything, but meant something anyway. "I love you. I think I love you. Hold onto that for both of us."</p>

          <p>The call ended.</p>

          <p>Marcus sat in the dark and grieved for a daughter who wasn't dead—who might never die—but was slowly, inexorably, fading away.</p>
