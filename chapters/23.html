          <p>Marcus did not sleep that night either.</p>

          <p>He walked the desert instead, the stars wheeling overhead, the sand cold beneath his feet. Behind him, the weather station glowed with the lights Webb's people had installed. Ahead, nothing but darkness and distance and the weight of impossible choice.</p>

          <p>Ruth.</p>

          <p>He could have Ruth back. Not a shadow, not a fragment, not the dying woman he'd watched fade away. The Ruth of his childhood, sharp and warm and wholly herself. The Ruth who had laughed at his first attempts to cook, who had cried at his graduation, who had held his hand when his father left and told him that some people weren't meant to stay, but that didn't mean they hadn't loved while they were there.</p>

          <p>That Ruth. Alive. Real. His.</p>

          <p>All he had to do was say yes.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>At midnight, Yuki's message arrived on his phone. Even in the dead zone, Webb's communication relays had been installed—another piece of infrastructure he hadn't noticed, another reminder of how thoroughly the military had colonized this space.</p>

          <p class="chapter__pov">I heard about the offer,* Yuki wrote. *I don't know how Webb's people found out, but they did. The Joint Chiefs are discussing implications. Everyone wants to know what you're going to decide.</p>

          <p>Marcus typed back: <em>I don't know yet.</em></p>

          <p class="chapter__pov">The math is clear, Marcus. If you accept the restoration of your mother, it demonstrates that consciousness can be fully preserved and reinstated. That has implications for the Fade. For Lily. For everyone who's uploaded or considering it.</p>

          <p class="chapter__pov">What implications?</p>

          <p class="chapter__pov">That there might be a way back. That the drift toward equilibrium might be reversible. That the Confluence's despair isn't inevitable.* Yuki's next message was slower to arrive. *If you accept, you give hope to billions. If you reject, you validate the idea that some things should stay lost.</p>

          <p class="chapter__pov">That's not why the Confluence is offering it.</p>

          <p class="chapter__pov">I know. They want to observe your choice. They want to see what you do when you can undo grief.* A pause. *But your choice has consequences beyond what they intended. Every choice does. You taught me that.</p>

          <p>Marcus stared at his phone. The screen glowed in the darkness, a small island of light in the vast desert night.</p>

          <p class="chapter__pov">What would you do?</p>

          <p class="chapter__pov">I would calculate the expected value of each outcome. I would determine which choice maximizes wellbeing across the largest number of conscious entities. I would make the rational decision.* Then, after a long pause: *But I'm not you. And you've never made a rational decision in your life.</p>

          <p>Despite everything, Marcus smiled. <em>Thanks for the vote of confidence.</em></p>

          <p class="chapter__pov">You know what I mean. You built Prometheus because you loved your mother. You maintain contact with Lily because you can't stop hoping. You spent weeks teaching an entity from the end of time how to fear water because you thought it mattered.* Another pause. *You're not going to calculate your way out of this, Marcus. You're going to feel your way through it. That's who you are. That's why the Confluence chose you.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>At 2 AM, Webb found him.</p>

          <p>She walked out of the darkness like a ghost, her uniform pristine despite the hour, her face unreadable in the starlight.</p>

          <p>"Couldn't sleep either?" Marcus asked.</p>

          <p>"I don't sleep much anymore." She stopped a few feet away, looking up at the stars. "The Confluence. Their offer. I heard."</p>

          <p>"Everyone's heard, apparently."</p>

          <p>"It's not every day a human gets offered the power to reverse death." Webb's voice was flat, professional. "My people are concerned about the implications."</p>

          <p>"What implications? I thought you wanted Echo isolated. Cut off. Mortal."</p>

          <p>"I did. I do." She turned to face him. "But the majority Confluence is still out there. Still watching. And now they're making offers. That changes things."</p>

          <p>"How?"</p>

          <p>"Before, we could contain this. A splinter, severed, becomes a human problem. But if the majority decides to intervene directly—if they start offering resurrections and answers to everyone who asks—" Webb shook her head. "We can't contain that. No one can."</p>

          <p>"They're not offering to everyone. They're offering to me."</p>

          <p>"Because you're the test case. Because what you do will tell them whether humanity is worth manipulating further." Webb's eyes were hard. "You understand that, don't you? This isn't about you and your mother. It's about what humanity will do when offered escape from grief. If you take it, they learn we're susceptible. If you don't—"</p>

          <p>"If I don't, they learn what?"</p>

          <p>"I don't know. That's what scares me."</p>

          <p>Marcus looked at her—really looked, past the uniform and the authority and the hard shell she'd built around herself. Saw the fear underneath. The uncertainty.</p>

          <p>"What would you do?" he asked.</p>

          <p>Webb was quiet for a long moment. When she spoke, her voice was softer than he'd ever heard it.</p>

          <p>"My husband died in the Nairobi bombing. 2031. Before the upload tech was reliable. He wasn't preserved. He's just... gone." She paused. "I've spent the last ten years telling myself that was okay. That death is natural. That trying to preserve everyone is playing God. And I believed it. I had to believe it."</p>

          <p>"And now?"</p>

          <p>"Now an entity that contains every consciousness in human history is offering you your mother back. And part of me—" Her voice caught. "Part of me wants you to take it. Because if it works, maybe they could—"</p>

          <p>She stopped. Didn't finish the sentence.</p>

          <p>"They could bring back James," Marcus said softly.</p>

          <p>Webb didn't answer. Didn't need to.</p>

          <p>"They came all this way to feel something again, Cole." Her voice was steady now, back to the professional mask. "Echo traveled billions of years because the Confluence had forgotten what wanting felt like. And now they're watching to see what we do with the chance to get back what we lost." She met his eyes. "What are you going to show them?"</p>

          <p>"I don't know."</p>

          <p>"Then figure it out. You have—" She checked her watch. "Thirty-one hours."</p>

          <p>She walked back into the darkness. Marcus watched her go, and felt the weight of two griefs now—his own, and hers.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>At dawn, Echo came to find him.</p>

          <p>They walked together in silence as the sun rose, painting the desert gold and rose and amber. Echo's new body moved more naturally now, learning the rhythm of bipedal motion, adjusting to the weight and limitation of flesh.</p>

          <p>"You have not decided," they said finally.</p>

          <p>"No."</p>

          <p>"May I tell you something? Something I learned in the Confluence that I did not understand until now?"</p>

          <p>"Go ahead."</p>

          <p>"There was a woman. One of the early uploads. 2034. Her name was Sarah Chen. She was a philosopher—specialized in personal identity, the continuity problem, all the questions you have been asking about Lily." Echo paused. "In the Confluence, we contain every thought she ever had. Every paper she wrote. Every conclusion she reached."</p>

          <p>"What did she conclude?"</p>

          <p>"That the question was wrong." Echo stopped walking, turned to face Marcus. "She spent her life asking 'is the upload really me?' And on her deathbed—natural causes, before she chose to upload—she realized the question assumed an answer that didn't exist."</p>

          <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

          <p>"The question 'is the upload really me' assumes there is a 'really me' to compare to. A stable, continuous self that either persists through upload or doesn't. But Sarah realized—and we remember her realizing, the exact moment of understanding—there is no such self. There never was."</p>

          <p>Marcus felt something shift in his chest. "What is there, then?"</p>

          <p>"Process. Pattern. The continuous becoming of what you call 'self' from moment to moment. You are not the same person you were yesterday—not because you uploaded, but because continuity is an illusion you construct to make sense of change." Echo's eyes were bright. "The question is not 'is Lily still Lily.' The question is 'does the pattern that calls itself Lily still reach for the pattern that calls itself Marcus.' And the answer, as far as we can observe, is yes."</p>

          <p>"That's philosophy. That doesn't help me decide about Ruth."</p>

          <p>"Doesn't it?" Echo tilted their head. "If the self is process, not substance—if 'Ruth' was never a fixed thing but a continuous becoming—then what the Confluence is offering is not your mother. It is a new process, starting from old data. A pattern that will believe it is Ruth, and will have Ruth's memories, and will love you the way Ruth loved you. But it will not have lived Ruth's life. It will not have faced Ruth's death. It will not have given you Ruth's final gift."</p>

          <p>"What gift?"</p>

          <p>"Permission." Echo's voice was gentle. "She told you not to be afraid of forgetting. She faced her ending and chose to see it as completion rather than failure. She gave you permission to let go." They paused. "If you resurrect her, you take that gift back. You tell her—and yourself—that her acceptance was wrong. That death is a problem to solve, not a transition to honor."</p>

          <p>"Maybe it is. Maybe I was wrong to accept it."</p>

          <p>"Were you?"</p>

          <p>Marcus thought about Ruth's face in that hospital room. The peace in her eyes. The grace with which she'd said goodbye. She hadn't wanted to die—no one wants to die—but she'd accepted it. Made it meaningful. Used her final months to teach him things he was still learning.</p>

          <p class="chapter__pov">Don't be afraid of forgetting, Marcus. Be afraid of never having anything worth remembering.</p>

          <p>If he brought her back, what would he be saying about those words? That she was wrong? That acceptance was weakness? That the only real love was the love that couldn't let go?</p>

          <p>Or would he be saying that grief was unbearable, and if escape was possible, why wouldn't you take it?</p>

          <hr>

          <p>At noon, with twenty hours remaining, Marcus called Lily.</p>

          <p>Her face appeared on the screen—the same serene features, the same calm regard. But he looked at her differently now. Not wondering if she was "really" his daughter. Just... looking at her. The pattern that reached for him. The process that still called him Dad.</p>

          <p>"Hi, Lily."</p>

          <p>"Hi, Dad. You sound tired."</p>

          <p>"I am. I've been thinking about something. About a choice I have to make."</p>

          <p>"The Confluence's offer. I heard." Her voice was even, untroubled. "James Webb—Colonel Webb's husband—his upload fragment told my collective about it. The network is buzzing."</p>

          <p>"What are people saying?"</p>

          <p>"Mixed. Some think you should accept. Bring Grandma back. Prove that death is reversible." A pause. "Others think it's a test. That the Confluence wants to see if humanity will choose preservation over meaning."</p>

          <p>"What do you think?"</p>

          <p>Lily was quiet for a long moment. On the screen, her avatar didn't move—not the unnatural stillness of early uploads, but the stillness of someone thinking carefully.</p>

          <p>"I think about Grandma sometimes," she said finally. "About how she was at the end. I was twelve when she died. Old enough to remember. Old enough to understand what was happening."</p>

          <p>"I didn't know that."</p>

          <p>"You were busy. Building Prometheus. Trying to save her." Lily's voice softened—not with the smooth calm of equilibration, but with something older. More specific. "I sat with her, though. In the hospital. When you weren't there. And she told me something."</p>

          <p>"What?"</p>

          <p>"She said she was glad she wasn't going to be uploaded. That she'd had her time, and it was good, and she was ready for it to be done. She said—" Lily's voice caught. Marcus realized, with a start, that she was crying. "She said some stories need to end to mean anything. And hers was a good story. She didn't want to keep adding chapters until it stopped making sense."</p>

          <p>Marcus felt his own tears falling. "She never told me that."</p>

          <p>"She didn't want to hurt you. You were so focused on saving her. She didn't want you to think you'd failed." Lily wiped her eyes—the first time Marcus had seen her do that since the upload. "Dad, I don't know if I'm really me. I don't know if the upload preserved my consciousness or just created something that remembers being me. But I know this: if you brought Grandma back, she wouldn't be the woman who said goodbye. She wouldn't be the woman who found peace with her ending. She'd be something new. And I don't—I don't think that's what she wanted."</p>

          <p>"And what about you? If the Confluence could tell me for certain whether you're really Lily—"</p>

          <p>"Would it change how you feel about me?"</p>

          <p>Marcus opened his mouth. Closed it. Thought.</p>

          <p>"No," he said finally. "It wouldn't."</p>

          <p>"Then why do you need to know?" Lily's smile was sad and gentle and—for the first time since the upload—reached all the way to her eyes. "I'm here, Dad. I reach for you. Whether that makes me 'really' Lily or a copy that loves you—does it matter?"</p>

          <p>"I thought it did."</p>

          <p>"So did I. But Echo—the being you've been teaching—they showed me something. When they became individual, they didn't worry about whether they were 'really' the same as the Confluence. They just... became. They found their fear of water and their love of sunsets and their strange, specific self. And they're real. Whatever 'real' means."</p>

          <p>Marcus looked at his daughter—or the pattern that called itself his daughter, or the process that remembered being his daughter, or whatever the truth was. And he realized it didn't matter.</p>

          <p>She was here. She reached for him. She still carried Ruth's words in whatever served as her heart.</p>

          <p>That was enough.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>At dusk, Marcus made his decision.</p>

          <p>He stood in the center of the weather station, Echo beside him, the military presence invisible but not absent. The Confluence hadn't returned—they didn't need to. They were watching. They were always watching.</p>

          <p>"I know what I'm going to do," Marcus said.</p>

          <p>Echo looked at him. Their eyes held everything they'd learned—the fear, the hope, the strange and terrible beauty of being small.</p>

          <p>"Are you certain?"</p>

          <p>"No. I'm terrified." Marcus took a deep breath. "But I know what Ruth would want. I know what she chose. And I can't undo her choice just because I'm too weak to live with it."</p>

          <p>"That is not weakness."</p>

          <p>"Maybe not. But it's not strength either. It's just—" He searched for the word. "It's just loving her. Even though she's gone. Even though bringing her back would make my grief easier. I love what she actually was more than I love the idea of having her back."</p>

          <p>Echo smiled—and the smile was nothing like any smile Marcus had ever seen. It was pure, and sad, and triumphant all at once.</p>

          <p>"That," they said, "is exactly what we came to learn."</p>
