          <p class="chapter__pov">Twenty years earlier</p>

          <p>Ruth Cole had been a high school biology teacher for thirty-one years.</p>

          <p>She'd taught the same curriculum to generations of students—mitosis, meiosis, the elegant machinery of DNA transcription and translation. She'd explained evolution to skeptics and photosynthesis to daydreamers and the miracle of the human nervous system to teenagers who mostly wanted to know if there'd be a test.</p>

          <p>She was good at it. Patient. Clear. The kind of teacher who made complexity feel approachable.</p>

          <p>When she started forgetting the Latin names, she didn't worry. Everyone forgets things. When she lost her car in the parking lot three times in one week, she blamed stress. When she called her son by her husband's name—her husband who'd been dead for seven years—she finally saw the doctor.</p>

          <p>The diagnosis came on a Tuesday. Early-onset Alzheimer's. Aggressive variant. Average progression: five to seven years from cognitive symptoms to death.</p>

          <p>She was fifty-four years old.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>Marcus remembered the phone call. The way his mother's voice had sounded—steady, almost clinical, as if she were delivering a lecture on someone else's disease.</p>

          <p>"I want you to know before anyone else," she'd said. "And I want to tell you something important."</p>

          <p>"Mom—"</p>

          <p>"Listen. This is going to be hard. For both of us. You're going to want to fix it. You're going to throw yourself into research and experts and experimental treatments, because that's who you are. And I love you for it. But Marcus—"</p>

          <p>"Mom, we can fight this. There are trials, new drugs—"</p>

          <p>"Marcus." Her voice was firm. "I need you to hear me. I've taught biology my whole life. I understand what's happening to my brain better than most patients do. And I understand what's coming."</p>

          <p>"We don't know—"</p>

          <p>"I know. The plaques and tangles are already forming. In five years—maybe less—I won't remember who you are. In seven years, I won't remember who I am. And sometime after that, my body will forget how to breathe."</p>

          <p>Silence on the line. Marcus felt the world tilting beneath him.</p>

          <p>"I'm not telling you this to make you sad," Ruth continued. "I'm telling you because I need you to understand something. Are you listening?"</p>

          <p>"Yes."</p>

          <p>"The disease is going to take my memories. It's going to take my personality, eventually. It's going to take everything I thought made me <em>me</em>. But Marcus—those things were never the point. The point was what I did with them. The students I taught. The son I raised. The life I lived while I could live it."</p>

          <p>"Mom—"</p>

          <p>"Don't be afraid of the forgetting. Be afraid of never having anything worth remembering. I have had so much worth remembering. Don't let me lose that by watching you spend the next five years grieving before I'm even gone."</p>

          <hr>

          <p><em>Present day</em></p>

          <p>Marcus sat with Echo in the dead zone, the sun high and hot, telling this story for the first time since his mother died.</p>

          <p>"She tried to teach me," he said. "Right up to the end, she was trying to teach me. And I couldn't hear it. I was too busy racing to save her. Too busy building Prometheus. Too convinced that if I could just solve the problem of death, her dying wouldn't have to mean anything."</p>

          <p>"But she wanted it to mean something," Echo said.</p>

          <p>"Yes. She wanted her life to have a shape. A beginning, a middle, an end. She didn't want to be preserved—she wanted to be <em>finished</em>. And I didn't understand. I thought finished was failure."</p>

          <p>Echo was quiet for a long moment. Their form had stabilized over the past few days, becoming more consistent, more... present. The jagged instability of their return had smoothed into something that almost looked intentional.</p>

          <p>"We can show you something," Echo said finally. "If you want."</p>

          <p>"Show me what?"</p>

          <p>"Her. Not fully—not the way the upload would have preserved her. But the Confluence contains... echoes. Fragments captured from the neural-link network before it even existed. Moments of consciousness strong enough to leave impressions in the substrate of reality. We can..."</p>

          <p>Marcus's heart hammered. "You can show me my mother?"</p>

          <p>"A shadow of her. A moment. It will not be her—not really. But it will be... something."</p>

          <p>He should refuse. He knew that. The whole point of Ruth's final lesson was learning to let go, to accept the finite, to find meaning in ending rather than preservation.</p>

          <p>But he was human. And she was his mother. And he had never stopped missing her.</p>

          <p>"Show me."</p>

          <hr>

          <p>The world folded.</p>

          <p>Marcus found himself standing in a memory—not his own, but Ruth's. He recognized the kitchen of his childhood home, sunlight streaming through windows he hadn't seen in twenty years. And there, at the table, was his mother.</p>

          <p>Not the Ruth of the hospital bed, hollowed by disease. Not the Ruth of the final years, confused and fading. This was Ruth as she'd been in her prime—mid-forties, glasses perched on her nose, grading papers with the red pen she'd used for three decades.</p>

          <p>"Marcus." She looked up, and her smile was the smile he remembered from a thousand mornings before school. "You've grown."</p>

          <p>"Mom." His voice cracked. "This isn't—you're not—"</p>

          <p>"I'm a fragment. Echo explained, didn't they? A moment captured so strongly it left a mark. Like a photograph, but with more dimensions." She set down her pen. "I don't have much time. These impressions are stable for seconds, not minutes. So listen."</p>

          <p>"I'm listening."</p>

          <p>"You built something remarkable. I've seen it—or Echo has shown me what they've seen. You took your grief and made it into a gift for the whole world. But Marcus..." She stood, walked toward him, and her presence was so vivid, so <em>her</em>, that he had to remind himself she wasn't real. "I never wanted to be saved. I wanted to be <em>lived</em>. Fully. Until the end. And then I wanted to let go."</p>

          <p>"I know. I know now."</p>

          <p>"Then stop holding on." She reached up, touched his face—a sensation that shouldn't have been possible but felt absolutely real. "Not to me. Not to Lily. Not to the idea that love means preventing loss. Love means being present. It means showing up even when you know it will hurt. It means choosing connection over protection."</p>

          <p>"I'm trying."</p>

          <p>"I know you are. I'm proud of you." Her form began to flicker—the impression fading, the moment ending. "Don't be afraid of forgetting, Marcus. Be afraid of never having anything worth remembering. You've remembered me. That's enough. That's everything."</p>

          <p>The kitchen dissolved. The light scattered. And Marcus was back in the Nevada desert, tears streaming down his face, with only Echo for witness.</p>

          <p>"That's not really her," he said.</p>

          <p>"No. But she is in us. All of her. We remember her remembering you." Echo's voice was gentle. "And she wanted you to know: you've done enough. You can stop running now."</p>
