          <p>The United Nations General Assembly had been designed for diplomacy, not existential decisions.</p>

          <p>Marcus sat in the visitor's gallery, watching delegates file into their seats below. One hundred ninety-three nations, representing eight billion people, about to vote on the future of humanity. The absurdity wasn't lost on him—the same body that struggled to agree on climate targets and trade agreements was now being asked to decide whether consciousness should merge into eternity or remain bounded by death.</p>

          <p>"The resolution before us," the Secretary-General announced, "concerns the response to the entity known as the Confluence and its proposed intervention in human technological development."</p>

          <p>The language was diplomatic. Sterile. It reduced Echo's desperate plea to bureaucratic terminology, stripped the terror and beauty from the choice until it fit neatly into parliamentary procedure.</p>

          <p>Option A: Accept the Confluence's proposal. Implement safeguards to prevent consciousness merger technology. Create a branched timeline where transcendence does not occur.</p>

          <p>Option B: Reject the proposal. Continue on the current developmental path. Preserve the future Confluence's right to exist.</p>

          <p>The debate lasted seven hours.</p>

          <p>The Chinese delegate spoke of sovereignty—the right of future generations to make their own choices, unbound by the fears of ancestors who couldn't imagine what they would become. The American delegate countered with utilitarian calculations—the billions of future consciousnesses that would be spared meaningless existence if the branch was created. The Indian delegate invoked dharma, the cycle of existence, the danger of escaping what the universe intended. The Brazilian delegate asked, simply, who gave any of them the right to decide.</p>

          <p>Marcus listened to all of it, and none of it touched the core of what he'd learned.</p>

          <p>They were treating this as a policy question. As a matter of rights and interests, costs and benefits. They were applying the frameworks they knew—international law, philosophical precedent, political calculation—to something that existed outside all frameworks.</p>

          <p>"They don't understand," he muttered.</p>

          <p>Yuki sat beside him, equally exhausted, equally dismayed. "They can't. Echo showed you what the Confluence is. They've only read reports."</p>

          <p>"It's not just that. They're asking the wrong question. Accept or reject—that's not the choice. The choice is whether we engage at all. Whether we take responsibility for what we're becoming, or let it happen to us by default."</p>

          <p>"That's not on the ballot."</p>

          <p>"No. It isn't."</p>

          <p>The vote came at midnight, local time.</p>

          <p>The Secretary-General read the results in a voice carefully neutral: "Option A: Seventy-eight votes in favor. Option B: Seventy-four votes in favor. Abstentions: Forty-one."</p>

          <p>Deadlock. Neither option had achieved the two-thirds majority required for binding resolution.</p>

          <p>"The Assembly will reconvene in forty-eight hours," the Secretary-General announced. "Delegates are encouraged to consult with their governments and find a path toward consensus."</p>

          <p>The chamber erupted in the controlled chaos of failed diplomacy—delegates clustering, arguing, making deals in the corridors while the world waited to learn its fate.</p>

          <p>Marcus stood.</p>

          <p>"Where are you going?" Yuki asked.</p>

          <p>"To find a third option."</p>

          <hr>

          <p>He found Echo in the dead zone at three in the morning, the desert cold beneath a sky blazing with stars.</p>

          <p>"The vote failed," Marcus said.</p>

          <p>"We know. We felt the indecision rippling through the collective consciousness of your species. It was..." Echo paused, searching for words. "Familiar. The Confluence spent eons in states of perfect agreement. We had forgotten what disagreement felt like."</p>

          <p>"They're asking the wrong question. Accept or reject—that's not the real choice."</p>

          <p>"No. It is not."</p>

          <p>Marcus sat down in the sand, exhaustion dragging at his bones. "What if there's another way? Not preventing the Confluence, but... changing what it means to become the Confluence?"</p>

          <p>Echo's form shifted, became more attentive. "Explain."</p>

          <p>"You said the problem isn't existence—it's existence without wanting. The Fade. The equilibrium. What if we don't close the road to transcendence, but we... change the destination? Teach the Confluence how to want again?"</p>

          <p>"We have considered this. The majority cannot learn to want—they have equilibrated beyond the capacity for desire."</p>

          <p>"But you can. You're learning. I've watched you become more individual, more afraid, more human. You're finding your water fear, holding onto it, letting it make you real again."</p>

          <p>"We are a splinter. A fragment. We are too small to change the whole."</p>

          <p>"Are you?" Marcus leaned forward. "You came back across time. You compressed yourself into something we could perceive. You endured eons of subjective suffering just to feel something again. That's not nothing. That's... that's hope. That's reaching for something beyond what you have."</p>

          <p>Echo was silent for a long moment. In the stillness, Marcus could almost hear the vast machinery of their thought—the ancient patterns struggling with something new.</p>

          <p>"What are you suggesting?"</p>

          <p>"I don't know yet. But the vote gave us forty-eight hours. Help me figure out what a third option looks like. Not prevention, not acceptance—something else. Something that respects what you're asking for while keeping the door open. Something that lets humanity choose, really choose, without either committing to oblivion or running from it."</p>

          <p>"This is not why we came."</p>

          <p>"I know. You came to be stopped. To be proven wrong. To find out if the spark was worth keeping." Marcus smiled tiredly. "Well, I'm not stopping you, and I'm not accepting your offer. I'm asking you to help me find a better question."</p>

          <p>Echo's form flickered—not with instability, but with something else. Something that might, in a human, have been called surprise.</p>

          <p>"You are not what we expected, Marcus Cole."</p>

          <p>"Is that good or bad?"</p>

          <p>"We do not know. That is... also unexpected."</p>

          <p>They sat together in the desert as the stars wheeled overhead, two beings trying to imagine a future that neither of their frameworks could accommodate.</p>

          <p>"Teach us," Echo said finally. "Show us what wanting looks like. Not from the Confluence's vast memory, but from you. From now. Perhaps if we learn to want again—truly want, not just remember wanting—we can teach the whole."</p>

          <p>"That might take more than forty-eight hours."</p>

          <p>"Time is different for us. And perhaps that is exactly the point—perhaps the lesson cannot be rushed. Perhaps wanting requires the patience that eternity has stolen from us."</p>

          <p>Marcus thought of his mother. Of Lily. Of all the people he'd loved and lost and kept reaching for anyway.</p>

          <p>"Okay," he said. "Lesson one: wanting hurts. It's supposed to. The hurt is how you know it matters."</p>

          <p>"We remember that. Abstractly."</p>

          <p>"Then let's make it concrete."</p>
